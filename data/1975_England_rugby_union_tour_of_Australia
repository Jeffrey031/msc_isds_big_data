The 1975 England rugby union tour of Australia was a series of eight matches played by the England national rugby union team in Australia in May and June 1975. England won only four of the eight matches and lost both internationals to Australia. In addition to the two test defeats they also lost to the Sydney and New South Wales Country representative teams.
The England selectors boldly, and in the circumstances quite rightly, chose an experimental squad for this, England's first tour of Australia. That the experiment was not altogether successful, nor the tour the team building exercise it had been intended to be, was largely due to the extraordinary number of injuries suffered by the England squad, frequently to key players.
