A by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of Bankstown on 31 January 1987 following the resignation of sitting Labor party member, Ric Mochalski who was facing charges over the collapse of a property trust. Mochalski gave the reason for his resignation as ill health, however the NSW Parliamentary Superanuation Fund rejected a claim based on ill health following a report from the NSW Chief Medical Officer.The Bankstown by-election was held the same day as the Heathcote by-election.
