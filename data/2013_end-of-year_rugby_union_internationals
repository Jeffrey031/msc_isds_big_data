In 2013, a record 39 test matches took place, with a record 24 matches including a tier 2 or tier 3 side, six of which being a tier 1 v tier 2 fixture, as the IRB builds up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Australia made their first tour of the Home Nations since 2009. However, they could not achieve a first Grand Slam since 1984 following their 20–13 defeat to England in the opening week of their tour. In addition, Australia played Italy in Turin for the first time. World cup winners New Zealand played France - for the fourth time in 2013, England and Ireland. South Africa played Wales, Scotland and France while Argentina played England, Wales and Italy.
Three invitational teams were in action against international teams during November. The Māori All Blacks visited Canada and the United States, while the French Barbarians faced Samoa. The Barbarians and Fiji contested the Killik Cup, which marked 100 years of rugby in Fiji.
As in other recent seasons, New Zealand and Australia played the third Bledisloe Cup match.
