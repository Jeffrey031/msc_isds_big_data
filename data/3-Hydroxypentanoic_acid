3-Hydroxypentanoic acid, or beta-hydroxypentanoate is a 5-carbon ketone body.  It is made from odd carbon fatty acids in the liver and rapidly enters the brain.  As opposed to 4-carbon ketone bodies, 3-hydroxypentanoic acid is anaplerotic, meaning it can refill the pool of TCA cycle intermediates. The triglyceride triheptanoin is used clinically to produce beta-hydroxypentanoate.
