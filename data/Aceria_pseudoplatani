Aceria pseudoplatani causes the sycamore felt gall that is found on the leaves of sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus) or Norway maple (Acer platanoides), and is caused by an acarine gall-mite.


== Appearance ==
The gall forms a bulge on the upper epidermis where the pigment colour is usually light yellow to start with and brown later on in the year. The appearance on the lower epidermis is a concavity with cream or white coloured felt-like mat which later turns brown. The bulge is due to the erinae or hairs being wider at their top. In purple-leaved varieties of the sycamore the patches are pink. The size of the felt-like patches is variable and they may appear from late spring onwards.


== Distribution ==
The Sycamore Felt Gall is quite common and is widespread through the United Kingdom and is also recorded from Poland, Belgium and Germany.
