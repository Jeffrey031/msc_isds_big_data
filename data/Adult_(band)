Adult (stylized with punctuation as ADULT.) is an American band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1998. The band integrates vocals with drum machines, analog synthesizers and electronic/punk elements.


== History ==
Adult was formed in the late 1990s in Detroit by Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller. They have described their work as "a dark, dance aesthetic that harnesses the perverse aspects of the late '70s analog dystopian post-modernism". Kuperus performs vocals on the band's song.
Adult have remixed the work of artists including Liars, John Foxx, and Death in Vegas. The band has released seven studio albums on MUTE Records, Ghostly International, Thrill Jockey and their own label founded in 1995, Ersatz Audio. They released their first live album in 2017 on Third Man Records.
Their sixth album, "Detroit House Guests" (2017 Mute), was funded by a John S. and James L. Knight Arts Challenge award, and featured guest collaborations from Dorit Chrysler (NY Theremin Society), Shannon Funchess (Light Asylum), Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe (Lichens), Michael Gira (Swans), Lun•na Menoh (Les Sewing Sisters) and Douglas McCarthy (Nitzer Ebb).
Their seventh album "This Behavior" was released on Dais Records in September 2018.


== Other projects ==
Before Adult, Miller was one half of the band Le Car and released his solo material under the name Artificial Material. Kuperus (who is also responsible for Adult's album artwork and photography) has sung on the works of other electronic acts including Death in Vegas, Swayzak and Chicks On Speed. Kuperus has also showcased her photography at museums around the United States and Europe. Between 2008 and 2010, Adult created the film "thee Three Graces tryptic: Decampment, Traditions & Possession(s)."  The film could only be seen with Adult performing the score live.  It was screened at Anthology Film Archives (NY), Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit), Distrital y Cineteca National: Mexico City Film Festival amongst other theaters.  In 2010, Adult wrote and recorded the original score to the film OPEN by Jake Yuzna.  In 2013, the art museum Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh invited Adult to make an elaborate installation.  The duo created a piece called Diptyching  which included audio, video, and the re-creation of a life size façade of a house.  In conjunction with the piece, Adult released a limited edition 12" Work/Wreck  which included the music from the installation.  Both Kuperus and Miller  continue to exhibit their visual work, while also writing new music and touring extensively.


== Current ==
As of 2019, Adult are currently in the studio working on their eighth album, which is scheduled for a spring 2020 release on Dais.


== Band members ==
Both band members have art degrees from College for Creative Studies. Adam Lee Miller has a painting degree, and Nicola Kuperus a photography degree.
