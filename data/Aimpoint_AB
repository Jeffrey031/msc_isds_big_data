Aimpoint AB is a Swedish optics company manufacturing red dot sights for civilian, police and military use. Comp series sights, such as the CompM2, are the most popular and is currently used by numerous armed forces around the world.


== Company ==
Aimpoint AB is a manufacturing company founded in 1974 and is based in Malmö, Sweden. Their primary products are reflector (or reflex) sights, specifically the red dot sight sub-type. In 1975 they introduced their first commercial product, the "Aimpoint Electronic" red dot sight,  based on a design by Helsingborg engineer John Arne Ingemund Ekstrand. This is claimed to be the first light-emitting diode "red dot" reflector sight ever manufactured. They currently offer many product lines based on this technology as well as accessories.  In 1997 Aimpoint was awarded the first multi-year military contract ever for a red dot sighting system when the US Army purchased their Aimpoint CompM2, designated the “M68 Close Combat Optic”.


== Products ==

Aimpoint currently sells a large line of red dot sights marketed to hunters, marksmen, law-enforcement agencies, and military organizations all over the world. Nearly 3,000,000 sight are in use world wide today.
All of their products use non-magnifying optical collimators (reflector or "reflex" sights) along with battery powered light-emitting diodes to produce a red aiming point. Many sights utilize a type of mangin mirror system, consisting of a meniscus lens corrector element combined with the semi-reflective mirror (what Aimpoint's advertising calls a "two lens" or "double lens" system), that compensates for spherical aberration, an error that can cause the dot position to diverge off the sight's optical axis with change in eye position. Aimpoint markets their sights as "parallax free", but this seems to refer to their off-axis spherical aberration correction system at one optimized distance. Aimpoints, like all other collimated sight systems, induce some parallax at ranges other than the ptimized due to the nature of the collimator.Aimpoints divides its products in to two categories: professional products and commercial (hunting and sport) products. In most Countries Aimpoints has different distributors for commercial and professional sector.

=== Aimpoint mounting standards ===
While red dot sights like Aimpoint Hunter, 9000, PRO, CompC3 and similar use 30 mm rings for mounting (Hunter 34 models are an exception, since they use 34mm mounting rings), Aimpoint also developed separate mounting standards for some of their red dot sight. Most common are the following.

Aimpoint Micro: this mounting standard features asymmetric longitudinal profile with an additional recoil stop in the center. It is the most common mounting standard for "micro" format red dots and is being extensively used by other optical manufacturers as well (Blaser, Holosun, Sig Sauer, MAK). Many scope mounts manufacturers produce mounts for this standard as well.Aimpoint Comp: this mounting standard is unique for Aimpoint professional red dot sight in the Comp series. Some manufacturers of tactical gear and mounting solutions produce non-original mounts for this platform, however majority of available mounting solutions of this type are original and supplied by Aimpoint.Aimpoint ACRO: the new ACRO red dot sights are equipped with a new mounting standard that is similar in design to already existing Micro, but in a more compact form. This was also necessary since bigger Micro mounting plates would not fit most of handguns.
