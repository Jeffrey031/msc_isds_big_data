== Critical reception ==
Website Taste of Country reviewed the song favorably, saying that "After back-to-back mid-tempo hits, this song gets back to the band’s rock roots without pouring it on too heavily for radio success, like maybe they did with their debut, the Top 40 hit “Musta Had a Good Time.” The song should find few obstacles on its way as it climbs the charts in 2015."
