"And This Is My Beloved" is a popular song from the 1953 musical Kismet, credited to Robert Wright and George Forrest. Like other music in the show, this melody was in fact based on music composed by Alexander Borodin, in this case, the nocturne from the third movement of Borodin's String Quartet No. 2 in D. 
The same melody had earlier (1946) been used for a song credited to William Engvick, Bert Reisfeld and Alec Wilder entitled "Spring Magic," which was recorded by Charlie Spivak and his Orchestra.
