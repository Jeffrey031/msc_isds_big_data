== History ==
The school was founded in 1960 as a girls' primary school.  In 1964, it became a girls' secondary school, and began admitting boys in 1965. The school has occupied several sites. Formally situated at Stevens Road and Anderson Road, Anderson Secondary School moved to Ang Mo Kio Street 44 in 1984. In December 1993, it moved to its current location, Ang Mo Kio Street 53.
Anderson Secondary School have been used from time to time for educational experiments. In 1994 it was declared an autonomous school for consistent academic performance, and in 1996 it was one of the first schools to use the Students-and-Teachers Workbench project. In 1997 it was chosen as an IT demo school. The school received the School Distinction Award by the Ministry of Education in 2004.


=== Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools ===
From 2003 to 2006 the school underwent a Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing school upgrading project. The school raised funds for a student activity hub, a heritage centre and a multi-purpose studio, upgraded the lecture theatre and classrooms and added a five-storey building.
The final stage of the upgrading process took place in 2005. Some facilities, such as the school hall, cookery rooms and the football field, were ready in July 2006.
A facility called the "Inspire Town" was opened in 2005. This is a room where innovation and creativity is encouraged amongst pupils. Two classrooms were converted into a black box theater for use by drama students.In 2008, an indoor sports hall was opened.


=== Uniform and Attire ===
Girls wear a white blouse and a kelly blue tunic knee-length pinafore. Lower secondary boys wear a pair of short trousers while upper secondary boys wear a pair of white long trousers. Students wear the school badge, with their name tag directly below it. Students wear the school tie on Mondays, and at formal school functions. On Casual Friday, students are allowed to wear Half-Uniform, PE-Shirts or their Class T-shirts to replace their school shirt. From time to time, if there is an increase in temperature, the school may allow Half-Uniform from Tuesdays-Thursdays, with PE-Shirt the only choice.


=== Discipline ===
The Anderson Secondary School Discipline Committee has classified offences committed by students into minor and major offences. Minor offences include being late for school, flaws in personal grooming and use of electronic devices during curriculum time. Major offences include absenteeism, forgery, arson and many others. Boys who commit any of the major offences are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning. In the most serious cases, they are caned in front of the other students (known as "public caning"). Girls are never caned at Anderson but must attend detention class if they carry out any of these acts instead. A stroke of cane for boys is equivalent to 5 days of detention class for girls.
