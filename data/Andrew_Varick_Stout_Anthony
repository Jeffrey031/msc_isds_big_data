The illustrated edition of Geraldine (a "rhythymic [sic?] romance" written by Alphonso A. Hopkins in 1881) was published in 1887 with illustrations "drawn, engraved, and printed under the supervision of A.V.S. Anthony." It is a particularly interesting edition because the illustrations are not only demonstrative of the themes, but are accurate drawings of sites and features along the St. Lawrence River.
