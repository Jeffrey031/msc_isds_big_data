== Plot ==
Apocalypse, CA is the story of John Parsons and his ill-fated friends as they prepare for certain death at the hands of a massive asteroid, sex-inducing drugs, a three-hundred foot giant, and a horde of other unfortunate problems.
Mysterious radio personality and apparent part-time genie, 'Sassy Boots' (Elizabeth Sandy) takes it upon herself to grant John Parsons (Nick Mathis) a few wishes five days before the world is to be destroyed by an asteroid. Only problem is John's wishes aren't exactly calculated, or even planned - the end result of which is a situation far worse than before.
Accompanied by his brother Hank (Alexander Cardinale), Hank's friend Renee (Anne McDaniels) and John's childhood crush Jacklyn (Erin Bodine), John and friends take the high road to Palm Springs - otherwise known as the 'epicenter' where the asteroid will first strike Earth. With a 'bite the bullet' approach, John & friends learn a little more about life and each other, all leading up to a wild climax of booze, sex, fantasy, and guns-a-blazin' desert adventure.
