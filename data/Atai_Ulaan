Atai Ulaan, in Buryat mythology, is leader of the 44 tenger of the eastern skies, in contrast to his brother Han Hormasta, who is leader of the 55 tenger of the western skies. "Also known as Galta Ulaan...  He is a common person in Turkish and Mongol mythologies. He is husband of Mayas Hara Toodei. Abai Geser married his daughter  Gaguurai Nogoon." The army of Atai Ulaan consisted of 6,666 soldiers.Atai Ulaan "made thirteen magicks dance on his palm and twenty-three magicks dance on his fingers".Han Hormasta's son "Bukhe Beligte threw a great black spear that smashed the big toe of Atai Ulaan’s right foot." "Malevolent disease spirits came out of the remains of Atai Ulaan and tormented humans" (, suggesting that the tale of the stubbing of Atai Ulaan toe may allude to the ailment gout, which most commonly afflicts the big toe). The disease-spirits which thus originated were : Gal Nurma Khan, Sherem Minata Khan {cf. the "Sherem" in the Book of Jacob, chapter 7 -- Yaʻqōb (Jacob) wrestled with the angel in like manner as did Zasa Mergen Baatar}, Abarga Sesen, Loir Hara Lobsogoldoi, and the "Yonhoboi sisters of  Loir Hara Lobsogoldoi".
