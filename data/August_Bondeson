August Bondeson (February 2, 1854, Vessigebro, Sweden-September 23, 1906, Gothenburg, Sweden) was a Swedish author and depictor of popular culture. 
He is one of the most popular depictors of popular Swedish culture, focusing in particular on common people's lives in southern Sweden, close to his birthplace. Tales such as "Halländska sagor, samlade och berättade" (Collected and Narrated Hallandic Tales), "Allmogeberättelser" (Popular Tales) och "Historiegubbar på Dal" (Tale-telling Old Mans at Dal) gave him a large and faithful audience. 
He is best known for his novel "John Chronschoughs memoarer från uppväksttiden och seminarieåren" (John Chronschough's memoirs), which is set at the teachers' seminary in Gothenburg in the early 1860s. The book was published in 1897 and was followed by an independent second part 1904.
His home Fågelboet (the Bird's nest) was donated to the County Museum of Halland and is preserved almost unchanged since the days of Bondeson.
