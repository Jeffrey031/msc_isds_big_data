Ayr Castle was a castle situated at Ayr in Scotland. Once considered a royal castle, nothing remains of it above ground.


== History ==
In 1197, the castle was built by King William the Lion of Scotland, who later in 1205 created a burgh at Ayr. The castle was captured by the Norwegian King Håkon Håkonsson and his supporters in 1263. Robert the Bruce burned the castle in August 1298 which had been captured by the English and under the command of Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy. The castle in 1542 was garrisoned by French troops and appears to have been demolished before the Cromwellian occupation between 1650–1651.
