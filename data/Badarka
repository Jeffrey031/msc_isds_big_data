== About The Founder ==
Badarka was founded  in 1643 AD by Raja Harbans, an official at the court of Shah Jahan, who received a grant of 500 Bighas from the Emperor in pargana Harha. He built a fine house here with walls of limestone blocks to a height of about 500m, surmounted with turreted walls, on an elaborate frieze of red stone over the gateway, having alternately Geese & Elephants in pairs. A large hall of audience supported on carved pillars formerly stood here, but Asaf-ud-daula is said to have taken these pillars to help building Imambara at Lucknow.
The house built by Raja Harbans was very picturesque and massive, and the strength of its construction was calculated to defy the hands of time.
