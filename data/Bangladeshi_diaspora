The Bangladeshi diaspora consists of people of Bangladeshi descent who have immigrated to or were born in another country. First generation migrants may have moved abroad from Bangladesh for better living conditions, to escape poverty, to support their financial condition or to send money back to families in Bangladesh. Annual remittances received in Bangladesh were 15.4 billion dollars as of 2015.There is a large Bangladeshi diaspora population in Saudi Arabia, where there are almost 1.2 million. There are also significant migrant communities in various Arab states of the Persian Gulf, particularly the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, where Bangladeshis are mainly classified as foreign workers. The United Kingdom's 2001 census found 300,000 (500,000 in 2009 census) British Bangladeshi mainly concentrated in east London boroughs (Tower Hamlets and Newham); the migration to Britain is mainly linked with chain migration from the Sylhet Division (95% of the UK-Bangladeshi population are from the Sylhet Division who are also regarded as Sylheti diaspora). Besides the UK and Middle East, Bangladeshis also have a significant presence in the United States, mainly in New York City (where many are also from Sylhet, Chittagong, and other regions) and Paterson in New Jersey, in East and Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, and in other Western countries such as Italy, Canada, and Australia.

The British Bangladeshi community is one of the largest immigrant communities in the United Kingdom, and is well established in many parts of the UK, most notably London, mainly in the East London boroughs, of which the Tower Hamlets has the highest percentage of Bangladeshis with about 33% of the borough's total population. Other boroughs include Newham, where 12% of the boroughs population is Bangladeshi, Redbrige, with 7%, Barking and Dagenham, with 5%, and in North London is Camden, where 7% of the borough is Bangladeshi. The national census of ethnicity and identity found over 400,000 (95% are Sylhetis) people had Bangladeshi heritage in Britain. There is also a significant community in and around Westminster. Sylhetis residing in London are often referred to as Londonis. The Sylheti dialect is the third most spoken language in London, after English and Polish. 

Outside London, the Bangladeshi diaspora lies in areas such as Birmingham, with a population over 35,000 Bangladeshis, Sandwell with over 7,000 residents, specifically wards such as St Pauls., Tipton, and West Bromwich, Oldham, with over 15,000, Luton, with over 13,000, and Bradford with over 10,000, and Manchester, with over 10,000 British Bangladeshis. Other smaller populations include Portsmouth with over 6,000, Sunderland and Newcastle upon Tyne with over 3,000 people each, St Albans with 2,200, Leeds with 4,500, and Leicester with 3,500. The British Bangladeshi has grown drastically, and has grown from 283,000 residents (according to the 2001 UK Census), to 451,000 residents (according to the 2011 UK Census) of Bangladeshi descent.
Mass migration started since the days of the British Raj, where lascars from Sylhet were often sent to the United Kingdom. Some of these lascars lived in the United Kingdom in port cities, and even married British women. Since then, mass migration has occurred, specifically from Sylhet.
The street of Brick Lane in East London, has a large history of Bangladeshis and has officially been dubbed as "Banglatown", and has hundreds of "Indian" restaurants nearly all owned by Sylheti Bangladeshis. Many British Bangladeshis have made their presence in the UK, often becoming doctors, engineers, and lawyers, but also many have become politicians for the Labour and Conservative Parties, such as Rushanara Ali, and Tulip Siddiq, as well as London Borough Mayors, such as Lutfur Rahman and Nasim Ali.


=== United States ===

The census in 2000, found up to 95,300 were born in Bangladesh, therefore it is estimated there are at least 150,000 Bangladeshis in the United States. It was until the 1990s when Bangladeshis, many from Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet, started to move to the United States, and settled in urban areas such as New York, Paterson in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, New Jersey and Washington D.C.. Although recent findings claim that Bangladeshis started arriving during the late 19th centuries from the southern part of current Bangladesh. In some parts of Queens and Manhattan in New York City, there are Bangladeshi restaurant owners of Bangladeshi, Indian, and Pakistani restaurants. The Baishakhi Mela celebration of the Bengali New Year is also held by the Bangladeshi American communities in New York, Paterson, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlantic Cityand other cities annually. The street of 3rd Street, Los Angeles has a large history of Bangladeshis and has officially been dubbed as "Little Bangladesh". However, some Bangladeshis residing in New York have settled in newer areas, such as Hamtramck, Michigan, Buffalo, New York, Paterson, New Jersey, and many other nearby states due to lower living costs and better job opportunities. Many Bangladeshis in New York City are often Taxi Drivers, Fast-Food Chain Workers, Restaurant Workers, etc. In Atlantic City many work in casinos.


=== Italy ===

Bangladeshis are one of the largest immigrant populations in Italy. As of 2013, there were more than 113,811 Bangladeshis living in Italy. Most of the Bangladeshis in Italy are based in Lazio, Lombardy and Veneto with large concentrations in Rome, Milan and Venice.


=== Canada ===

Main influx of migration of Bangladeshis started early 80's. Back in 1988, about 700 Bangladeshi families lived in Toronto, though about another 900 families were living in Montreal. When Canadian Immigration opened up with Independent Category, huge number of educated Bangladeshis moved to Canada. Under Investor Category about 1100 families moved to Canada since 2015. By 2017 June, it is estimated that around 354,595 Bangladeshi people live in Canada, primarily in the provinces Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Alberta. The cities they live in include Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, and Ottawa.
Like most immigrants to Canada, Bangladeshi Canadians are distinct from other Bangladeshi diaspora groups because they are split between French-speaking and English-speaking Bangladeshi Canadians. This distinction is most obvious in eastern Canada.
