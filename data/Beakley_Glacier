Beakley Glacier (73°51′S 119°50′W) is a glacier on the west side of the Duncan Peninsula on Carney Island, flowing north into the Amundsen Sea. It was delineated by the United States Geological Survey from aerial photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in January 1947, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Vice Admiral W.M. Beakley, U.S. Navy, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Ship Operations and Readiness during the IGY period, 1957–58.
