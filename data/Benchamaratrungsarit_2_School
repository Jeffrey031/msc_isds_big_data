== Chinese language program ==
Ben 2 School has a special program to help students improve their Mandarin Chinese. The Chinese Course is a program designed to enhance Chinese learning overseas in a joint effort between the Thai and Chinese governments to expand the use of Mandarin. The Thai schools that want to join the program are screened for their standard of education and if they qualify, they can apply to the Thai Educational Department for Chinese teachers to teach in their schools. Every year, the Chinese government sends qualified Chinese teachers to Thailand to teach Chinese.
It has been two years since Ben 2 joined the Chinese program.  Currently, the course is open to students between grades 8 and 11. Beginning next semester, it will be available to students sitting for the grade 12 national exams. Students can opt to take the Chinese examination during the exam to help them qualify for university courses requiring Mandarin as a language.
