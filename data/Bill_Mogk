While attending Michigan, Mogk played baseball for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team from 1950 to 1953 and earned varsity letters in 1951, 1952, and 1953.  He was a second baseman as a sophomore in 1951 but moved to first base for his junior and senior years.  During the 1952 season, Mogk was perfect on defense, going the entire year (his first at first base) without an error.  He was "the first Wolverine to play errorless for an entire season."  In December 1952, Mogk was elected by his teammates as the captain for the 1953 team.  The 1953 team won the College World Series for the first time in the school's history.

He graduated from Michigan in 1954 with a bachelor of arts degree in history.
