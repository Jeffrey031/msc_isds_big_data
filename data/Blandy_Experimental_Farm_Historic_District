Graham F. Blandy bequeathed 700 acres of his approximately 900 acre estate to the University of Virginia, which accepted it after his death in 1926. The University began its program of agricultural biology at Blandy in 1927, and converted part of the landscape into an arboretum, now known as the Orland E. White Research Arboretum. The slaves quarter's, referred to as the Quarters, was converted into laboratories and student and faculty housing. In 1941, the Quarters building was greatly enlarged with the addition of three Colonial Revival wings. This addition created a "U"-shaped building with the original Quarters section as the east wing. A research greenhouse was built at the same time.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
