Breeding of Mind is an album by American jazz guitarist O'Donel Levy recorded in 1972 and released on the Groove Merchant label.


== Reception ==
Allmusic's Jason Ankeny said: "Breeding of Mind pairs guitarist O'Donel Levy with arranger Manny Albam for a genre-defying set that embraces elements of jazz, funk and baroque pop -- the end result is soulful and sublime, couching Levy's uncommonly expressive tone in a series of bold, lush contexts that underline the sophistication of his craft".
