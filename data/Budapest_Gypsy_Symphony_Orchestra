== History ==
In 1984, soloist and Hungarian Romani conductor, the Primas (first violin and leader) Sándor Járóka ('The Primas of kings and the king of Primases') died.
At his funeral, the Roma community gathered. Musicians gathered and from a gloomy serenade over a grave, the group was born. 
The orchestra became world famous. Budapest rehearsals were repeatedly visited by György Cziffra, the Hungarian gypsy pianist who later became the Association's honorary president. 
László Berki, the conductor of the National Hungarian State Ensemble, led the orchestra until his death in October 1997. It is his doing that Hungary's best musicians are members. Members have family names such as Lakatos, Lendvai Csócsi, Boross, Berki, all Hungarian Romani musician dynasties.
In 1997, Sándor Rigó Buffó became conductor and artistic director. He rose to President since December 2005.  He died on 27 April 2014. Nándor Beke Farkas was the President and the leader of the orchestra from May 2014 and the new artistic director with József Lendvai Csócsi as violin master.
