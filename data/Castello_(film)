In prison, he is known as Castello. After leaving prison, Castello tried to trace his wife and son. But he was disappointed when he learnt that his daughter Phim had become a drug addict. Castello strives to save Phim who is unaware that he is her father. One day Castello took Phim's money while the girl was dealing with drugs. Because of his overload, beyond Castello's consciousness, Phim has met drug traffickers and told him about his financial problems.
The distributor gives Phim the drugs she needs. But at the time Phim was high, she was raped by the distributors' friends as her debt to the distributor. Castello 'goes crazy' as soon as it finds Phim's destruction. He was determined to take revenge. But while struggling to defend his dignified child's dignity, Chalita (Castello's wife) was killed by the distributors' friends. Of course, Castello became angry and he acted more crazy.
