Catchment hydrology is the study of the hydrology in drainage basins.


== Water balance ==

Catchment hydrology is based on the principal of continuity, which is used to perform a water balance on a catchment:

  
    
      
        I
        −
        O
        =
        d
        S
        
          /
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle I-O=dS/dt}
  ,
where 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
   = inputs (P, precipitation + OW, occult water), 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
   = outputs (ET, evapotranspiration + R, runoff), and 
  
    
      
        d
        S
        
          /
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle dS/dt}
   = the change in catchment storage over time.
Neglecting the minor inputs of occult water, the water balance can be revised to

  
    
      
        P
        −
        R
        −
        E
        T
        =
        d
        S
        
          /
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle P-R-ET=dS/dt}
  .
Finally, considering a catchment on a long time scale, typically a year or more, removes the storage component from the equation:

  
    
      
        P
        −
        R
        =
        E
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle P-R=ET}

== Terminology ==
There are many terms involved with and related to catchment hydrology. These basic ones are taken from the glossary of terms in Kendall and McDonnell, 1998:

aquifer
baseflow
catchment
drainage divide
evaporation
evapotranspiration
event water
groundwater flow
Horton flow
hydrograph
infiltration
intensity
interception
overland flow
pre-event water
subsurface runoff
subsurface stormflow
surface runoff
time of concentration
transpiration
