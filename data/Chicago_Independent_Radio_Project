The Chicago Independent Radio Project (CHIRP) is a non-profit organization that operates a community radio station (CHIRP Radio) currently accessible via its web site and also on 107.1 FM, via a new low-powered transmitter located in the Uptown neighborhood. CHIRP is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization funded primarily through individual giving, special event revenues, and grant support.


== History ==
From 2007-2010, CHIRP partnered with organizations across the country to help convince Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to remove existing barriers to the granting of low power FM radio licenses in urban areas. In 2009, CHIRP's President and Vice President, Shawn Campbell and Jenny Lizak, were invited to lead a White House meeting on the issue with President Obama's technology team. The bill CHIRP worked on to expand low power FM was the Local Community Radio Act, which was signed into law in early 2011.On January 17, 2010, CHIRP began as an online radio station. The first song played was "Thank You Friends" by the band Big Star.
In June 2011, CHIRP Radio was named "Best Overall Radio Station" by the Chicago Reader in its annual Best of Chicago issue.In late 2014, CHIRP received a construction permit from the FCC to build a Low-Power FM broadcast outlet on Chicago's north side. In October 2017, the organization launched its broadcast at 107.1 FM with call letters WCXP-LP.
