== History ==
Amazon Web Services began hosting Common Crawl's archive through its Public Data Sets program in 2012.The organization began releasing metadata files and the text output of the crawlers alongside .arc files in July of that year. Common Crawl's archives had only included .arc files previously.In December 2012, blekko donated to Common Crawl search engine metadata blekko gathered from crawls it conducted from February to October 2012. The donated data helped Common Crawl "improve its crawl while avoiding spam, porn and the influence of excessive SEO."In 2013, Common Crawl began using Apache Software Foundation's Nutch webcrawler instead of a custom crawler. Common Crawl switched from using .arc files to .warc files with its November 2013 crawl.
