Cookin' Soul is a Spanish producer-DJs duo known separately as Big Size and Zock. Producing work since around 2005, the two have developed a strong presence in the mixtape circuit in the US, according to El Pa√≠s.


== Critical response ==
The Guardian gave a project they did a mixed review, indicating that "some of the mash-ups work magnificently...but several needed more time spent on them" than the single night allocated to it by the trio. Also in 2008, MTV mentioned "Public Speeding", a mashup of Jay-Z's "Public Service Announcement" and Coldplay's "High Speed", as an example of the "strangely compelling flow" of blending "worlds-apart sounds".  In 2009, the trio released a tribute mixtape to Michael Jackson, with the Washington Post describing their blend of Jackson 5 and Lil Wayne on "I Want You Back" as "unexpectedly touching/weird."
