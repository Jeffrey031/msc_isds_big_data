Cormier House (French: Maison Ernest-Cormier) is an Art deco residence in the Golden Square Mile, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, located at 1418 Pine Avenue.


== Ownership ==

It was built by architect Ernest Cormier as his own residence in 1930-31. The building was proclaimed as a historical monument in Quebec in 1974. In 1979 the property was bought by 15th Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau for $230,000 and served as his home following his retirement from politics in the summer of 1984 until his death in 2000.
It has been owned since 2000 by his son Alexandre, younger brother of the current prime minister Justin Trudeau.


== Description ==
Cormier experimented with a variety of styles in the house: Art deco on the facade, monumental on one side and more Modernist in the back. Cormier created most of the furniture, with remaining pieces acquired at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts DÃ©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.


== Recognition ==
Cormier House has been designated as a historic property under Quebec's heritage legislation, the Loi sur les biens culturels.  The house appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011.
In 2018, the Ernest Cormier House was designated a National Historic Site, and Ernest Cormier was named a National Historic Person.
