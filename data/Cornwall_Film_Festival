The Cornwall Film Festival (Cornish: Gool fylm Kernow) is an annual festival, first established in 2002, which focuses on supporting and celebrating the film and media industry in Cornwall.  Aside from the annual festival, the organisation also engages with film-makers and audiences throughout the year by offering local and national premieres, and hosting masterclasses, workshops and discussions for everyone from the enthusiast to the professional.
The film festival has been recognised by a number of well-known individuals in the film industry, such as film critic Mark Kermode, who created a five-minute promotional video for the event in 2013.The festival supports Cornish film making in both the Cornish and English language and there is a "govynn kernewek" competition in which applicants present their idea for a film in the Cornish language, with the winners receiving financial, material and technical support for the production.
Many film-makers who work solely in English will refer to themselves as Cornish film-makers. Their films often make use of Cornish themes, landscape and way of life. Certainly the concept of a Cornish film industry exists, the term 'Oggywood' has been coined (from oggy meaning pasty and Hollywood). Similarly there has been a Young People's Festival which runs a day prior to the main festival. This has run for the same amount of time as the main festival.
In 2014, a new director was appointed by the board to create a "sustainable creative vision" for the future of the festival.The 2019 event is scheduled to take place from the 15–17 November at The Poly in Falmouth.
