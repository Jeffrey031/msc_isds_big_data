Croatia will participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. The Croatian broadcaster Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) used the national selection Dora 2020 to decide their representative.


== Background ==

Prior to the 2020 Contest, Croatia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty-five times since its first entry in 1993. Croatia's highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been fourth place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 1996 with the song "Sveta ljubav" performed by Maja Blagdan and in 1999 "Marija Magdalena" performed by Doris Dragović. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004 contest, Croatia had featured in seven finals. In 2019, Croatia failed to qualify to the final, placing 14th in the second semi-final with the song "The Dream" performed by Roko.

=== Dora 2020 ===
Dora 2020 was the twenty-first edition of the Croatian national selection Dora, which selected Croatia's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. The competition consisted of up to 16 entries competing in one final.


==== Format ====
The combination of points from a viewer vote and ten regional jury groups determined the winner. According to the competition rules, in the event of a tie for the first place, the winner was the entrant ranked highest by the public televote.


==== Competing entries ====
Artists and composers were able to submit their entries to the broadcaster between 5 November and 15 December 2019. An expert committee selected sixteen artists and songs for the competition from the received submissions. The list of competing artists and songs were released on 23 December 2019. Shortly after the list was released, Goran Karan withdrew from the competition. As a result of this, Elis Lovrić and her song "Jušto" participated in the national selection instead.


==== Final ====
The final took place at Opatija, on the 29 February 2020, and was hosted by Duško Ćurlić, Mirko Fodor, Zlata Mück Sušec and Doris Pinčić Rogoznica. The running order for the final was revealed on 17 February 2020 via Croatian radiotelevision's official web page. The winner was determined by a 50/50 combination of points awarded by regional juries and from the public televote. In case of a tie, the song that scored better in the televote wins the tie.

== At Eurovision ==
According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2020, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Croatia was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 12 May 2020, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.
