Czechoslovakia competed at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. 104 competitors, 95 men and 9 women, took part in 64 events in 13 sports. The most successful competitor was Věra Čáslavská (one of only 9 women in crew) with 4 medals - 3 gold and one team silver. Other big surprises were gold medal performances of the cyclist Jiří Daler and weightlifter Hans Zdražila, who broke a world record during his performance. Medal hopes of world record holder athlete Ludvík Daněk were fulfilled with little disappointment, in the form of a silver medal.
