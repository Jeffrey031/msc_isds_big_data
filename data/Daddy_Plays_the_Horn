Daddy Plays the Horn is a 1955 jazz album by saxophonist Dexter Gordon.


== Reception ==
The Billboard review stated that the album was "not too original, but it swings" and mentioned that Gordon played "some top-flight, Lester Young-inspired tenor here, with a more robust sound than that of the master or most of his other disciples". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded it three out of four stars, saying "Daddy would be worth the purchase for 'Confirmation' and 'Autumn in New York'... Drew and Vinnegar play exceptionally well, and the CD transfer is generally good."
