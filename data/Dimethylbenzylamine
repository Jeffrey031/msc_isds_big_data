Dimethylbenzylamine is the organic compound with the formula C6H5CH2N(CH3)2.  The molecule consists of a benzyl group, C6H5CH2, attached to a dimethylamino functional group. It is a colorless liquid.  It is used as a catalyst for the formation of polyurethane foams and epoxy resins.


== Synthesis ==
N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine can be synthesized by the Eschweiler–Clarke reaction of benzylamine 


== Reactions ==
It undergoes directed ortho metalation with butyl lithium:

[C6H5CH2N(CH3)2  +  BuLi  →    2-LiC6H4CH2N(CH3)2
LiC6H4CH2N(CH3)2  +  E+  →    2-EC6H4CH2N(CH3)2Via these reactions, many derivatives are known with the formula 2-X-C6H4CH2N(CH3)2 (E = SR, PR2, etc.).
The amine is basic and undergoes quaternization with alkyl halides (eg hexyl bromide) to give quaternary ammonium salts:
[C6H5CH2N(CH3)2  +  RX  →    [C6H5CH2N(CH3)2R]+X−Such salts are useful phase transfer catalysts.
