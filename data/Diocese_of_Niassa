The Diocese of Niassa (pt. Diocese Anglicana do Niassa) it is one of the three Anglican dioceses of Mozambique, part of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. This diocese is geographically the central of the three, the others being the Diocese of Lebombo and the Diocese of Nampula.


== History ==
Mark van Koevering, an American of Dutch descent, was the diocesan bishop from 2003 to 2015. The diocese itself was not able to elect a bishop to succeed him and so the synod of bishops of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa in September 2016 named Vicente Msosa as the bishop elect, being consecrated bishop of the Diocese of Niassa on 25 February 2017.


== Structure ==
Niassa diocese is divided into six archdeaconries: Cobue, Lunho, Lichinga, Milange, Rio Chire and Lurio.
The diocese has 426 congregations, over 65,500 worshipers, and 55 priests. It has a link with the Diocese of London in the Church of England.
