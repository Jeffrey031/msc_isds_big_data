The place of the synagogue was previously a mosque which was founded according to historical resources in 1400 AD, and which was called the mosque of Sidi Al Harbi after one of the saints of Algiers, and it remained it until the French occupation of Algeria in 1830, where the French sold the area surrounding the mosque to the Jews of Algeria who destroyed the mosque and built in its place A synagogue for them in 1845.
Transformation into Ben Farès Mosque
Following the departure of the Jews of Algiers who carried French nationality (since 1870 by the decree of Crémieux) with the french colonizers after the independence of Algeria for political reasons, the synagogue was transformed into a mosque called "The Mosque of Ben Farès ".
The origin of the name of the mosque, according to what was indicated in the book of "mosques of the city of Algiers, its zaouïa and its sanctuaries in the Ottoman era" of Ben Hamoush, is attributed to the district in which lived Ali Abdul Aziz ibn Farès, who fled Andalusia after its fall in 1492 and who entered Bejaia and then in Algiers and settled in the Kasbah district.
