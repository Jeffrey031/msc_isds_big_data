Donald E. Meehan (born April 10, 1951) is an influential Canadian National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) hockey player agent.


== Early career ==
Meehan earned his bachelor's degree at Sir George Williams University. At McGill University, during his final year of law school, Meehan played for the Redmen as a wide receiver under coach Charlie Baillie.After earning his law degree (LLB 1975) at McGill, Meehan was hired by Toronto law firm Blaney, Pasternak. Most of the cases he originally dealt with were corporate and tax-related. The firm also had some ice hockey players as clientele.


== Newport Sports Management ==
Declining the offer of a partnership from his law firm, Meehan decided in 1981 to create his own company that focused on hockey players. Named Newport Sports Management Inc. and operated in a partnership with fellow agent Pat Morris, it represents over 100 NHL players.Instead of approaching players that are already in the National Hockey League (NHL), Meehan approached the families of young talents before they were drafted by the NHL. One of the first young talents Meehan was an agent for was the talented centre Pat LaFontaine—LaFontaine hired Meehan a few months before he entered the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.
