It was built between 1896 and 1898, and is a two-story, three-bay frame house with Eastlake Movement / Stick Style decorative elements.  It features a wraparound porch which is double-tiered in the central bay and graced by delicate sawnwork and turned posts.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  It is located in the Haymount Historic District.
It is named after the successful businessman, politician, and civic leader who built it; not the well-known American author Edgar Allan Poe.
