Epinephelus corallicola, commonly known as the coral grouper, coral rock-cod, or duskyfin grouper, is a coastal-dwelling fish of the Western Pacific. The species is commonly found in shallow silty reefs and sometimes in estuarine areas.


== Description ==
The coral grouper resembles both Epinephelus howlandi and Epinephelus macrospilos. The body is brownish to greenish grey, with small black spots over all of the head, body and fins, becoming more numerous and widely spaced with growth. It grows to 49 cm (19 in) total length, possibly larger.


== Distribution ==
The coral grouper is found in the Western Pacific Ocean, including Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and southward to Australia, as well as eastward to the Solomon Islands and Mariana Islands.


== Habitat ==
The coral grouper may be found in either brackish or salt water. Its habitat is primarily shallow silty reefs, in water depths up to about 30 m.


== Utilization ==
Epinephelus corallicola is present in life reef food fish trade and small-scale commercial fishers, but it is not considered commercially important.
