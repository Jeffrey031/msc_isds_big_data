== Biography ==
Dağlarca's purist use of the Turkish language brought a new dimension to contemporary Turkish literature. His poems treat themes such as the prehistory of mankind and the cosmos, but also antimilitarist themes and the Turkish War of Independence.
A selection of his poems have been translated into English by Talat Sait Halman (Selected Poems, Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1969).
Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca died on 16 October 2008 in İstanbul at the age of 94. He was laid to rest at the Karacaahmet Cemetery on 20 October 2008 following a funeral ceremony held in the Süreyya Opera House that was attended by politicians and high-ranking officials.
