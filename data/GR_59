The GR 59 Grande Randonnée long-distance footpath in France connects two mountain ranges across relatively low-lying terrain.  In the north, it begins at Ballon d'Alsace in the Vosges at a height of over 1000m.  It loses height rapidly, and runs south-south-west through the département of the Haute-Saône to Besançon on the River Doubs, in the département of the same name.  It then follows a circuitous route, partly along the River Loue (a tributary of the Doubs) to Lons-le-Saunier in the département of Jura.  At St-Amour just south of Lons, the GR 9 splits from the GR 59 and takes a more easterly route, near the Swiss border, while the GR59 continues into the regions of Bugey and Revermont in the département of Ain, finally rejoining the GR 9 near Yenne on the banks of the Rhône; the GR 9 then continues to the Mediterranean at St-Tropez.
