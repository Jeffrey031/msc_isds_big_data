Besides having numerous business ventures which she is a partner of, Aparna (Geetha) joins as a teacher in a non-profitable organisation, against her mother's wishes. A kid named Abhimanyu in her class grabs her attention. Later, she finds that Abhimanyu's father is a famous playwright, Yatheendran, alias Yathi (Mammootty), a man whom she once loved. Yathi's latest play titled "Aparna" was inspired by her life. Aparna treated Abhimanyu with the utmost care until a mysterious man named Jagadeesh Nair (Mohanlal), claiming to be the biological father of Abhimanyu, landed from the USA to take Abhimanyu with him. Aparna learns that Abhimanyu was none other than the son of her late twin sister Atheena (Geetha), who was married to Jagadeesh.
