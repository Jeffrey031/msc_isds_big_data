== History ==


=== Incorporation ===
The Go-Ahead Group plc began as Go-Ahead Northern Limited on 17 February 1987 on the privatisation of the National Bus Company, when a partial management buyout led by Martin Ballinger and Chris Moyes purchased its Gateshead-based northern division, known as the Northern General Transport Company. Early expansion saw the acquisition of certain smaller competing bus operators in North East England (principally Gypsy Queen in 1989 and Low Fell Coaches in June 1992). Go-Ahead Northern also became a National Express sub-contractor operating services to the Midlands, North East, North West and South West England. At the same time, Go-Ahead Leisure purchased a number of pubs, which were sold in February 1996.


=== 1993: Expanding south ===
Despite bidding for a number of other larger bus operators in the intervening period, Go-Ahead's first major acquisition was Brighton & Hove in November 1993, followed by the Oxford Bus Company and Wycombe Bus Company in March 1994. In May 1997 the Brighton & Hove operation expanded with the acquisition of the former municipal operator Brighton Transport. In September 1999 Metrobus, a large operator operating in London, Surrey and Sussex was acquired.


=== 1994–95: Floatation and into London ===
Initially an unlisted public company owned 90% by management, in May 1994 Go-Ahead was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In October 1994 Go-Ahead purchased London Central during the privatisation of London Buses.In March 1995 OK Motor Services was purchased and integrated into the Go North East operation. In June 1996 a second London bus operation, London General was acquired from the management team that had purchased it when privatised.


=== 1996: Into rail ===
In October 1996 Go-Ahead entered the UK rail market when it commenced operating the Thames Trains franchise which it ran until March 2004. The Thames Trains franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Victory Rail Holdings. Go-Ahead owned 65% of the shares in Victory Rail Holdings with the remaining 35% held by some ex British Rail managers and employees. Go-Ahead bought the remaining shares it did not own in June 1998. Go-Ahead entered into a joint venture with VIA-GTI, taking a 65% stake in Govia. Govia ran the Thameslink franchise from March 1997 until March 2006.

Go-Ahead had a 39% stake in City Pendeln AB which was to operate the Citypendeln commuter rail business in Stockholm. Go-Ahead had a 29% stake in Sydvasten AB which operated rail services between Gothenburg and Malmö. Due to problems, Go-Ahead exited both ventures.
