Like all of South Dakota outside Native American counties, Gregory County is powerfully Republican. No Democrat has carried Gregory County since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Like almost all of rural America, recent swings away from the socially liberal Democratic Party have been very rapid: Donald Trump’s 76.5 percent of the county’s vote is the largest any candidate has obtained in the county since South Dakota statehood.
