Their second album, Server Error. was released with Mint 400 Records on 9 May 2017.  Will Vellek joined Guilty Giraffe in the Winter of 2018 on bass, and they played as a three-piece for a while, until Reis quit Guilty Giraffe in Spring of 2018 to follow other musical endeavors. Guilty Giraffe rebuilt the line-up, adding Kevin Knebel on drums, and Shane Sumano on bass. For the Mint 400 Records compilation NJ / NY Mixtape, which features artists that performed at 2018 North Jersey Indie Rock Festival, Guilty Giraffe contributed the song "Off Ripped." They also released their third album Filtered in 2018, which was entirely recorded by Felipe Reis and Mat Mcginnis years prior.
