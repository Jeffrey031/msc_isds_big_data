Hawera was a parliamentary electorate in the South Taranaki District of New Zealand from 1896 to 1908. It was represented by two Members of Parliament over the four parliamentary terms of its existence.


== Population centres ==
In the 1896 electoral redistribution, rapid population growth in the North Island required the transfer of three seats from the South Island to the north. Four electorates that previously existed were re-established, and three electorates were established for the first time, including Hawera. The New Plymouth electorate was abolished, the Egmont electorate shifted north, and the Patea electorate shifted east. This made room for the Taranaki and Hawera electorates. Settlements in the original Hawera electorate were the towns of Hawera, Manaia, and Eltham.In the 1902 electoral redistribution, Eltham was lost to the Patea electorate, but Opunake was gained from the Taranaki electorate. In the 1907 electoral redistribution, the Hawera electorate was abolished, and its area was distributed to the Patea and Egmont electorates.


== History ==
Felix McGuire was the electorate's first representative. As an independent conservative, he had previously represented the Egmont electorate since a 1891 by-election after the resignation of Harry Atkinson. In the 1902 election, McGuire was defeated by Charles E. Major of the Liberal Party. McGuire and Major once again contested the Hawera electorate in 1905, and Major remained successful.The Hawera electorate was abolished at the 1908 election. Major stood in the Patea electorate, but was defeated by the conservative politician George Pearce.
