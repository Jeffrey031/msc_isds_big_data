Holdstrong was a hardcore band from Massachusetts which started out in 1993 and lasted until the late 1990s.


== History ==
Holdstrong formed in the spring of 1993, with core members Matt Myrdal and Bill Cole. That summer they replaced the original singer with Chris Berthiaume and recorded their first effort Gaining Ground, which was released as the first record ever put out by Pin Drop Records, and which proved to be the start of success for both the band and the label.
