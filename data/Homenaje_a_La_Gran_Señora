The album's release marks four years since Rivera's death. Jiménez told the Associated Press, that her and Rivera were planning to record an album and embark on a tour. She also stated, "Although many of these songs have also been recorded by many other singers, I feel that many of these songs were famous thanks to Jenni." Jimenez told Univision's Despierta América, that she has been wanting to record a mariachi/ranchera album and she wanted to do something with Rivera's music because she liked it a lot. The title of the recording is a reference to Rivera's honorary title "The Great Lady" ("La Gran Señora").
