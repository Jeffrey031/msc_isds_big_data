Upon the death of her parents, little Hulda find herself sole guardian of her three small brothers. Fortunately, she receives a letter from her wealthy Uncle Peter in Pennsylvania inviting the three orphans to come to America and live with him. Shortly afterwards, Uncle Peter drives to the Port of New York to pick them up, but is injured by an automobile accident and taken to a hospital where he lies unidentified. Uncle Peter's disappearance not only causes distress to the three newly arrived Dutch immigrants, but also to a railroad president (Mr. Walton) who is trying to buy the right-of-way through Uncle Peter's farmland and has only three deals left in which to close the deal. The search for the old man by both Hulda and Mr. Walton's son result in a blossoming romance between the two.
