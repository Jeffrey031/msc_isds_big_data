Ibarbengoa is a future station of line 1 of Metro Bilbao. It is located in the neighbourhood of Andra Mari, in the municipality of Getxo. The station was constructed to serve the northernmost part of Getxo and to become the northern terminus of the Greater Bilbao services between Etxebarri and Getxo. Construction of the station was finished in autumn of 2019 but its opening was delayed due to problems relating the construction of a park and ride facility next to the station.
The station will open to service in March, 2020.


== History ==
The creation of a new station in the northern, and mostly rural, neighbourhood of Andra Mari in Getxo had been planned for some time, being first announced in 2010 as part of a new urbanisation plan for the area. The plan included the construction of around 8,000 homes, a new metro station and a park and ride parking facility. The plan was met with strong opposition from the neighbours of Andra Mari, who claimed the plan benefited residential speculation and the urbanisation of an until then mostly rural area.The construction of the new station finished in 2014, but further protests delayed the construction of the parking facility, as a result the station remained closed. The parking facility was finally finished on late 2019.The station will open in March, 2020.
