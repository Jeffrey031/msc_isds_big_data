Ieuan Ddu ab Dafydd ab Owain (fl. 1440–1480), was a Welsh poet, also known as Ieuan Dafydd Ddu and Ieuan Dafydd ab Owain.
He resided at or near Aberdare, Glamorganshire, and, being a gentleman of large estate, was a generous patron of the bards. The first lines of some of his poems are given in Moses Williams's `Repertorium Poeticum,' London, 1726, 8vo.
