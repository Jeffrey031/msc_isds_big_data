He began to study journalism at the Complutense University of Madrid although he dropped off his studies, beginning his journalistic career in 1995, collaborating in newspapers such as Cinco Días and El Mundo and magazines such as Muy Interesante, Rolling Stone, GEO and Quo. In 1999 he joined in the nightly news of Telecinco, as responsible for El navegante, a section of the Internet broadcast daily. In 2004 he worked as a media consultant in Mexico and Ecuador. Back in Spain, he was named coordinator of the web of news of Telecinco. He left this post to become deputy director of La Voz de Almería, Cadena SER Almería, and Localia Almería, which would make him also an opinion journalist in programs or tertulias such as La Ventana and Hoy por hoy of the Cadena Ser. He returned to Madrid to be the first director of the newspaper Público, which he led from its founding in September 2007 until his dismissal on 13 January 2009.

He was a regular contributor to Hoy por hoy of Cadena Ser until he was fired, in April 2016, through a direct order from its headman, Juan Luis Cebrián.
