Imuruk Lake is the largest body of fresh water in Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. It measures 31 square miles and has a drainage basin of 102 square miles,  It lies on top of a lava plateau at an elevation of 960 feet. The drainage basin is relatively flat, as the maximum elevation is only about 1,600 feet. A low gap in the divide between the lake and the head of the right fork of Goodhope River rises only a few feet above the lake. The Fairhaven Ditch takes practically all its water from the lake. Serpentine Hot Springs flow to the Serpentine River, 47 miles northwest of Imuruk Lake.
