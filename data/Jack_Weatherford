Jack McIver Weatherford is the former DeWitt Wallace Professor of anthropology at Macalester College in Minnesota. He is best known for his 2004 book, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. In 2006, he was awarded the Order of the Polar Star, Mongoliaâ€™s highest national honor for foreigners.
His books in the late 20th century on the influence of Native American cultures have been translated into numerous languages. In addition to publishing chapters and reviews in academic books and journals, Weatherford has published numerous articles in national newspapers to popularize his historic and anthropological coverage of Native American cultures, as well as the American political culture in Congress in the 20th century. He has become a frequent commentator on TV and radio.


== Early life ==
Weatherford was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to Anna Ruth Grooms and Alfred Greg Weatherford, as the oldest of seven children. Their father was a sergeant in the United States Army, which caused the family to move often.  Now, Weatherford lives in Mongolia and Charleston, South Carolina. One of Professor Weatherford's distant ancestors is William Weatherford, a Creek leader of mixed race in the nineteenth century.


== Academic career ==
He graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1967, with a B.A in Political Science. In 1972, he received an M.A. in sociology from the University of South Carolina, and an M.A in anthropology in 1973. In 1977, he received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of California, San Diego. He earned a post-doctoral degree in policy studies from Duke University, Institute of Policy Sciences.
He became a professor of anthropology at Macalester College in Minnesota. He has written extensively on indigenous cultures in North American and in other countries. His books include Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World (1988), which was translated into numerous languages; Native Roots: How the Indians Enriched America (1991), and Savages and Civilization: Who Will Survive? (1994) on the contemporary clash of world cultures.  Weatherford's early books on Native Americans won the Minnesota Book Award in 1989 and in 1992. He also received the 1992 Anthropology in the Media Award from the American Anthropological Association, and the 1994 Mass Media Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
He became more widely known for his book, The History of Money (1997), which was chosen as a selection of the Conservative Book of the Month Club. In addition, Weatherford's articles about the anthropology of 20th-century American politics and analysis of its clans, have led to his being invited as a commentator on radio and television programs, including The Today Show, ABC Evening News with Peter Jennings, Geraldo's Now It Can Be Told, Larry King, All Things Considered, Nightwatch, Tony Brown's Journal, and the Voice of America. He has appeared in international programs from Bolivia to Mongolia.
Since the late twentieth century, Weatherford has studied and published on the cultures and history of Mongolia. His work has been recognized by that nation's government: in 2006, he was awarded the Order of the Polar Star, Mongolia's highest national honor. In addition, Weatherford was awarded the honorary order by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia and the medal of the President of Mongolia in 2010.


== Interests ==
Weatherford has worked with contemporary groups in places such as Bolivia and the Amazon. He has also worked with historical analysis such as the impact of the American Indians on world history. In recent years, he has concentrated on the Mongols by looking at their impact since the time that Genghis Khan united the Mongol tribes in 1206.
