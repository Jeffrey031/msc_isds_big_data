General Joachim (Jochum) Melchior Holten von Castenschiold (29 November 1743 – 6 April 1817) was a Danish officer before and during the Napoleonic Wars. Acquiring Borreby Castle in 1783, he was the first Castenschiold to own the manor which has been held by the family ever since.


== Biography ==
He was son of Johan Lorentz von Castenschiold of Knapstrup and his wife Jacoba von Holten. In 1760, Castenschiold went into training as an officer at the Slesvigske Kyrasserregiment, and was eventually promoted to major in 1776. He became commander of the Royal Danish Mounted Guard in 1784 (the regiment was eventually closed down in 1866). He was promoted further, becoming major general in 1788, and finally lieutenant general in 1802.
On a more curious note, Castenschiold became involved in the coup d'état against Count Struensee in 1772. Because of Queen Caroline Matilda's dislike of Castenschiold, he was chosen to escort her to Kronborg together with 30 dragoons after she was arrested.
In 1807, Castenschiold led the East Danish (mainly Zealandic) territorial force, which was established to fight Britain during the Napoleonic Wars. His efforts culminated in the Battle of Køge on 29 August 1807, where Castenschiold's force of around 7,000 militiamen was defeated by the well-equipped British forces under General Arthur Wellesley (later 1st Duke of Wellington). Castenschiold was later prosecuted together with the other military leaders in Copenhagen, but was acquitted.


== Personal life ==
He was part of the landed gentry. In  1781, when he was in his late thirties, he married Elisabeth Behagen. His holdings included the manor Borreby Castle which has been owned by his descendants ever since. He died on 6 April 1817 at Borreby and is buried at Magleby Church.


== In popular culture ==
Castenschiold appears as a character in Bernard Cornwell's 2001 novel Sharpe's Prey.
