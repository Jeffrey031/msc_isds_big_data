== Career ==
Born in Hill of Beath, Fife Durkin joined Edinburgh-based club Heart of Midlothian from local club Hill of Beath Ramblers in 1948, but did not make his Scottish Football League debut until 1951. He remained at Tynecastle Stadium until 1952, but played only sporadically, and joined Dunfermline Athletic in December of that year. In August 1953, he joined Gillingham of the Football League Third Division South. He signed for his new club on 21 August and made his Football League debut the following day in a match against Reading, during which he scored two goals in a 3–0 victory.  He missed only one first team match between his debut and the following January, but then missed the remainder of the 1953–54 season. The following season, he could not gain a place in the team, managing only three appearances when key players were injured, although on his first appearance for ten months he scored a goal in a 3–1 victory over Newport County.  He left at the end of the 1954–55 season to join non-league club Ramsgate Athletic of the Kent League in May 1955. No further details of his career are known.
