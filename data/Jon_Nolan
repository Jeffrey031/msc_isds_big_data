=== Lincoln City ===
Following Stockport's relegation, Nolan became a free agent and joined Conference Premier team Lincoln on a one-year contract on 23 May 2013. Manager Gary Simpson told BBC Radio Lincolnshire that Nolan took a long time to seal his deal due to another offer from a wealthier team in the division, but he chose Lincoln for "footballing reasons". He made his debut on 10 August, playing the full 90 minutes of a goalless draw at Woking in the season opener. On 14 September, he scored his first goal for the Imps, equalising with the final kick of a 1–1 draw at Barnet.

=== Shrewsbury Town ===
Following Chesterfield's relegation, Nolan moved to League One club Shrewsbury Town for an undisclosed fee on 12 June 2017, signing a three-year deal. The move re-united him with former Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1−0 win against Southend United on 12 September, helping set a new club record for Shrewsbury Town as their best ever start to a Football League campaign of six wins and a draw from their opening seven games.Shrewsbury reached the 2018 EFL Trophy Final, which they lost at Wembley to Nolan's former team Lincoln on 8 April.

The team finished in third, and on 10 May, in the first leg of the play-off semi-final away to Charlton Athletic, Nolan scored the only goal from 25 yards out. His final game was the play-off final at Wembley on 28 May, lost 2–1 to Rotherham United after extra time.In his only season at the New Meadow, Nolan was voted the club's Player of the Year.


=== Ipswich Town ===
