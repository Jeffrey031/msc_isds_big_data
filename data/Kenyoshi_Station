Kenyoshi Station was opened on July 1, 1897, as a station of the Nippon Railway. When the Nippon Railway was nationalized on November 1, 1906, it became a station on the Tōhoku Main Line of the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) and later the Japanese National Railways (JNR). Freight operations were discontinued from November 1982. The station has been managed from Hachinohe Station since February 1983. With the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, it came under the operational control of JR East. The station came under the control of the Aoimori Railway Line on December 1, 2002.
