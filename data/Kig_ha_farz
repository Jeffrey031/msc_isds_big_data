Kig ha farz is a cooked dish consisting of various meats simmered in a broth with a buckwheat flour based pudding. It is eaten traditionally in Brittany, more specifically around LÃ©on in the region situated west from Morlaix to Brest. This dish, which is quite similar to a pot-au-feu, was once considered a dish for the poor and peasantry.  The name in Breton literally means "meat and stuffing".
A cooking broth contains meats such as salted pork knuckles and beef along with vegetables such as carrots and cabbage. These ingredients are simmered together with a cylindrical cloth bag filled with a mixture of eggs, milk, and buckwheat flour (known locally as "black wheat") for several hours. The cloth sac containing the cooked buckwheat pudding (farz) is usually rolled and the contents broken-up before serving. The dish is presented with the cooked meats and vegetables and the farz is consumed with a sauce locally known as "lipig", made with melted butter, bacon, and shallots.
A variation of the buckwheat farz is  the "white" farz (far gwinizh) made using wheat flour, and preferred by children due to its light and sweet flavour. The white wheat based farz is also eaten in slices pan-fried with butter (farz fritet).
