It came into existence in 2002, occurring each year, then freezing over in the winter.The lake, which is approximately one foot deep, is composed almost entirely of fresh water melted from the ice beneath.A web camera is stationed beside the lake to monitor changes. It was built by the Polar Science Center.On July 26, 2013, the depth was estimated to be approximately 40 cm.Members of the scientific community are not alarmed by such bodies of water, stating that they occur widely, and often refer to them as "melt ponds".
