The following is a list of ancient Baltic peoples and tribes.


== Background ==
This is a list of the ancient Baltic peoples and tribes. They spoke the Baltic languages (members of the broader branch Balto-Slavic), a branch of the Indo-European language family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in area east of Jutland peninsula, southern Baltic Sea coast in the west and Moscow, Oka and Volga rivers basins in the east, to the northwest of the eurasian steppe. Modern descendants are the Lithuanians and Latvians (they themselves assimilated other related Baltic tribes).
