The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) operates more than 300 missions throughout the world. Most current missions are named after the location of the mission headquarters, usually a specific city.  The geographical area a mission actually covers is often much larger than the name may indicate; most areas of the world are within the jurisdiction of a mission of the church. In the list below, if the name of the mission does not include a specific city, the city where the mission headquarters is located is included in parentheses.
On January 2, 2019, the LDS Church announced changes that closed 12 missions through boundary realignments and opened up 4 new ones, effective July 1, 2019. As a result of these changes, as of July 2019, there were 399 missions of the church.


== Future mission creation ==
On November 21, 2019, the church's First Presidency announced the creation of 8 new missions that would begin operation in July 2020. With the creation of these new missions, as of July 2020, the total number of missions in the church will be 407.
