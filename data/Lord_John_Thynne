Rev. Lord John Thynne (7 November 1798 – 9 February 1881) was an Anglican cleric, who served for 45 years as Deputy Dean of Westminster.


== Origins ==
He was born in 1798, the third son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath (1765–1837) by his wife Hon. Isabella Elizabeth Byng, a daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington. 


== Inheritance ==
He inherited the estate of Haynes Park, Bedfordshire, and the manor of Kilkhampton in Cornwall from his childless uncle, John Thynne, 3rd Baron Carteret (1772–1849). Stowe House in Kilkhampton had been the seat of his distant ancestor John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701), and had descended from him via the Cartaret family.


== Career ==
He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge and was ordained by John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury in 1822. His first post was as curate of Corsley, a parish on his father's estate of Longleat. Next he served as Rector of Backwell, Street with Walton, and Kingston Deverill, all in Somerset and Wiltshire.  In 1828 he was appointed a canon and subdean of Lincoln Cathedral, then became a Canon of Westminster Abbey in 1831. He became sub-dean of Westminster in 1835, later declining the deaneries of Westminster, Wells and Windsor. He lived at Ashburnham House near Westminster Abbey and assisted at the coronation of King William IV and Queen Adelaide, and later at that of Queen Victoria.
