Don Lacho (José Luis Jiménez), a greedy old man, is about to die. His three children, but mainly his daughter-in-law Piedad (Silvia Pinal), are anxiously awaiting his death to collect the inheritance, but the old man refuses to die.
In his hallucinations, the old man sees the ghost of his dead wife (Kitty de Hoyos), who reveals that one of his three children is not his child. The man takes his last moments to torment all in doubt.
