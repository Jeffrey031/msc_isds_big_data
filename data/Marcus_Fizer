Fizer was selected with the fourth pick of the 2000 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, coached by Tim Floyd, the coach that recruited him to Iowa State. Many analysts suspected that the Bulls had drafted Fizer merely to trade him for another player, since the Bulls already had Elton Brand at the power forward position. However, no such trade ever took place, and Fizer spent the next four years with the Bulls. He never averaged more than 12.3 points per game. Fizer tore his ACL in late January 2003. In 2004, he was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats in the expansion draft. Not making their final roster, he signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Bucks.
