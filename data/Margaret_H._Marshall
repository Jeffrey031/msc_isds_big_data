== Early life ==
Marshall was born in Newcastle, South Africa, where she led a student organization for three years called the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS), which was dedicated to ending oppressive minority rule and achieving equality for all South Africans. According to Marshall, "There was no access to justice in South Africa...There were a few courageous barristers who agreed to represent people charged with political crimes, but, by and large, if you were a black South African, you had no justice. The death penalty was imposed in vastly disproportionate numbers. Many of the offenses were applicable to black South Africans only.". In June 1966, as NUSAS's vice president, she welcomed U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy to South Africa, in place of Union President Ian Robertson, who had been banned from political appearances. Marshall emigrated to the United States to escape political persecution. In Johannesburg she attended Kingsmead College, and in Delaware she graduated from the Tatnall School. She earned a master's degree in education from Harvard in 1969, and a J.D. degree from Yale in 1976. She acquired United States citizenship in 1978.In 1984, she married then-New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, to whom she remained married until his death in 2013.
