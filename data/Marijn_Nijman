Marijn Elise Nijman (born 27 August 1985) is a former Dutch international cricketer whose career for the Dutch national side spanned from 2004 to 2011.
Nijman was born in Groningen, and played her club cricket for Schiedam's Hermes-DVS. She made her senior debut for the Netherlands in 2004, and her One Day International (ODI) debut the following year, against Ireland. In 2007, Nijman was selected in the Dutch squad for its inaugural Test match. She was a regular in the team right up until it lost its ODI status at the 2011 World Cup Qualifier, which was her final international tournament. Nijman had little success at international level, but fared better in the Women's County Championship, in 2010 scoring 99 from 58 balls against Cornwall.
