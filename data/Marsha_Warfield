== Personal life ==
In 2017, Warfield publicly came out stating, "When I told my mother I was gay, she said she knew, and had known all my life.
Then, she asked me not to come out publicly while she was alive.
I agreed, even though the request and her admission were hurtful in ways I couldn't put my finger on then, and probably haven't completely worked through now.
But, everybody who knew me, knew I was gay.
The people I didn't tell knew anyway, and tacitly agreed to pretend that the unacknowledged had been acknowledged and accepted.
Like I'm sure is true for millions of other glass door closeted people.
When I went to bars, which was frequently, I never tried to hide who I was.
So, it was an open secret.
Had I never come out publicly, many, many people would have known.
It would not then have ever really been a betrayal of trust to "spill the beans."
Because it wasn't a secret, it was an uncomfortably kept promise to my mother.
But, it was also not the only reason I didn't come out swinging when she passed.
The fear of the judgment of strangers and their holier-than-thou "shoulds" was at least as big of a burden to bear.
But the "shoulds" that "should" matter don't.
Nobody should have to hide their sexuality.
No parent should ask their child to.
There should be no shame in being gay."
