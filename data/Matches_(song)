The music video was directed by Michael Salomon, and it begins with a male coming into his home which has been stripped of his possessions, and seeing the matchbook from his first date laying on the floor. The man then goes to The Broken Spoke, which he lights the matches and breaks various liquor bottles behind the bar and lights the matchbook on fire. As the man and the patrons evacuate the bar as it is engulfed in flames, the man is arrested as his ex-lover appears to survey the damage.
