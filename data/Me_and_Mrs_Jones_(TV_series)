== Reception ==
Me and Mrs Jones was not received kindly in early reviews. Writing for The Stage, reviewer Harry Venning wrote:

Of the many unkind epithets suggested by Roget’s Thesaurus, excruciating is the one that best describes this show. Until I watched it, I did not realise it was physically possible to grit one’s teeth, curl one’s toes and clench one’s sphincter all at the same time. And stay that way for half an hour.
Metro's reviewer was somewhat kinder, calling Me and Mrs Jones "grown-up comedy with child-like humour" (going on to explain that "child-like" was more akin to "childish").The British Comedy Guide reviewed it as follows: "We absolutely loved Me And Mrs Jones; it mightn't have had the packed-out laughs of a studio sitcom, but it oozed warmth, good humour and all-round likeability...If a second series isn't commissioned of this heart-warming, laugh-out-loud comedy, it'll be the televisual crime of the year."
