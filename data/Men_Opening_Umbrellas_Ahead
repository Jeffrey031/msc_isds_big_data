In 2010, an unauthorized CD reissue was made available by Harkit Records. The CD featured notes by Dutch dada-ist Freek Kinkelaar and featured two bonus tracks not on the original LP: "Baba Tunde" and "Lakonga". This edition is a sourced from a vinyl copy and is a "bootleg" not authorized by the Stanshall estate. The bonus tracks come from a rare 1974 single.Poppydisc Records released a remastered edition, on LP and CD, on 21 May 2012. These are the first re-issues to be authorized by the artist's estate. The remastered CD contains the two bonus tracks, while the vinyl version is the same as the original vinyl LP.
