Midleton CBS Secondary School is a Catholic secondary school for boys, located in Midleton, County Cork, Ireland. Midleton CBS was founded by the Congregation of Christian Brothers in 1867.


== History ==
The Christian Brothers arrived in Midleton in 1867 at the request of the parish priest who recognized the need of a dedicated school to educate the town's Roman Catholic male youth, at a time when the Church of Ireland's Midleton College was fast expanding. The local community provided donations for the cost of the construction, and the school opened on 3 April 1867, with over 300 pupils joining in its first week. The last of the Christian Brothers left the school in 2003, with the monastery and old school building being taken over by the Diocese of Cloyne for parish use.The school buildings were massively extended in the 2010s, in a project which cost €12.5 million.
