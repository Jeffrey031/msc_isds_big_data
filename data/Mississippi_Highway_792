== Route description ==
MS 792 is located in southern Lowndes and northern Noxubee counties. In 2012, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 1,800 vehicles traveling west of Trinity Road and Weyerhaeuser Road, and as few as 540 vehicles traveling south of Bluitt Road. It is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ยง 65-3-3, and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation.MS 792 starts at a T-intersection with US 45, near the Black Prairie wildlife management area. It travels east along Carson Road, going through a small group of trees and farmland. At Gun Club Road, the landscape changes completely into farmland. Near 3.5 miles (5.6 km) later, Carson Road intersects Weyerhaeuser Road, that leads to cellulose fiber mills. MS 792 later turns southeastward at Old Macon Road, and crosses over a river. South of Plum Grove Road, the route shifts slightly to the west. Old Macon Road enters Noxubee County, while crossing over a small creek. MS 792 continues south for a few more miles, before ending at MS 388.
