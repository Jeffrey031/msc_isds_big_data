The rivalry between Molde and Rosenborg is a notable one in Norwegian football as both clubs are recognised for having great history and traditions.
The rivalry had increased importance in the 1990s, as Rosenborg enjoyed the most successful period in the history of the club and Molde developed their team to become Rosenborgs biggest challenger for many seasons. From 1992 to 2004, Rosenborg became champions of Eliteserien thirteen times in succession. In the same period of time Molde won the Norwegian Cup in 1994 and finished second in the league four times (1995, 1998, 1999, 2002).
