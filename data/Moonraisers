Moonraisers are a reggae band formed in 1992 and based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.  Their style, a type of electronic reggae dubbed World’n’Moonstyle Reggae, joins roots reggae with funk, world and electro elements.They are best known for composing the original version of the dance super hit, Rise up. Although at the time it came out it didn't make any success, the song became a hit played in the dance clubs for months after Yves Larock made a dance cover of it.
