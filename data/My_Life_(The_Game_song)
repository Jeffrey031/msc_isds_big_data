== Background ==


=== Recording ===
Producers Cool & Dre have released a video documenting how they created the beat.The Game spoke on his working with Lil Wayne stating:

When you're in the studio with Wayne, you could pretty much chill, man, because everything is so easy. He's so melody-driven. Once he hits you with an idea, or I come up with an idea, we're straightforward, man. The process is easy. I think me and him could do an album probably in, like, seven days. A classic album! He keeps it 100, I keep it 100. We're both talented MCs. I appreciate him in hip-hop.


=== Samples ===
Lil Wayne re-sings sections of "So Tired", a song by Birdman in which Wayne is featured. Game tried to make this song have the same instruments of Eminem's song "Stan" of the album Marshall Mathers LP (2000).  Also at the beginning of the second verse, The Game samples a twice used Lil Wayne line from the remix of "Party Like a Rockstar", and "Phone Home", from Tha Carter III (2008):

== Controversy ==
When "My Life" was first leaked, many believed The Game was insulting Eminem. However, later on his website, Game denied these allegations, and apologized to anyone who might have misinterpreted what he had intended to say:
When I originally wrote the song "My Life" I was trying to think back on events that affected my life and how they changed me. When I first got signed to Aftermath and G-Unit I was exposed to so many different people from Dre to Em to 50 to Proof. I always identified with Proof. We were always cool and he would reach out to me when ever I was going through something. I remember when Proof died vividly and now every time I think about going to Detroit I get depressed. That is what I was trying to say in that verse and the more I looked at I realized that people would take it the wrong way…the way they are taking it now that it leaked. So I decided to change it so that this bullshit wouldn’t happen and now it’s happened anyway. For the record, this is not the version on my album, this is not the version that radio will get and this is not the version that I just shot the video to. Furthermore, I apologize to anyone who took this the wrong way as that was never my intention.
The exact lines which many understood as a diss were:

You see them 24's spinning? I earned 'em
And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned 'em
So there ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
And since there ain't no Proof, I'll never walk through 8 MileOn the version used in the music video, the lyrics have been changed to:

You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste, now
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race, now
