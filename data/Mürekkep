Sıla explained the preparation process of the album as follows: "We prepared a part of the album in our own studio and some parts of it in Athens. Some of them were prepared in the studio of Iskender Paydaş and some in the studio of Ozan Bayraşa. The studio phase was a long process. The writing stage of the songs had already begun when we released the album Yeni Ay. We like to spend more time in the studio as a team. Because different ideas and changes can arise. We don't leave the studio without sneaking out some new ideas. After completing everything and saying yes, we complete the studio phase."The audio mixing of the songs was done by Arzu Alsan, Alp Turaç and Dimitris Mourras. Steve Fallone from Sterling Sound performed the audio mastering. The album's photographs were taken by Emre Ünal. Cengiz Abazoğlu prepared the singer's outfits for the photo shoot.
