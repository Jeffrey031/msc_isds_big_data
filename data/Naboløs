Naboløs (literally "Without Neighbours")  is a short street in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark. All the buildings in the street are listed. Together with Hyskenstræde it will provide a direct link between the shopping street Strøget and the future metro station at Gammel Strand.


== History ==
In the Middle Ages the street was considered part of Hyskenstræde. In the 16th century it became known under various names. In 1551 it is thus  referred to as "that street where Niels Tommesen lives" (""thet strede som Niels Tommesen wdi boer") and in 1604 as Vejerhusstræde (Weighhouse Street) after the  weigh house (vejerboden) which had been built at Gammel Strand in 1581. The name Naboløs is first seen in 1713, probably because only one house fronted the street at that time. This situation lasted until the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. The street was again destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The Vejerbod was demolished in 1857.


== Notable buildings and residents ==

All six buildings in the street have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places.
