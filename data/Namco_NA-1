The Namco NA-1 is a 16-bit arcade system board which was first used by Namco in July 1992, and was the successor to the Namco System 1 and 2 system board; the company's first quiz game, Bakuretsu Quiz Ma-Q Dai Bōken, was the first game to use it. The Namco NA-2 is also backwards compatible with the NA-1. It is not yet known what extra features the NA-2 has apart from different MCU code - and the first game to run on it was Knuckle Heads.
