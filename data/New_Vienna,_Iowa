New Vienna was initially settled by a group of German immigrant families who were living in Ohio. These families had come to the area in search of farmland.
One such family was that of William Steffen Sr. and his wife Mary. William and Mary were originally from Recklinghausen, in what was then the Province of Westphalia and today is Germany. They came to the United States and settled in Ohio. William and Mary and their children joined the other German immigrant families who came to New Vienna in the 1840s. The descendants of William and Mary number in the thousands today, and some of their descendants still live in New Vienna and surrounding areas.
St. Boniface Catholic Church was established for the local families that established New Vienna. This church is notable for its late 19th century William Schuelke pipe organ. This organ is one of the few original remaining Schuelke Organs - except for an electric blower it has been basically unaltered since installation.
