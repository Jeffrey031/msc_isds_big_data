No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking (also known as No Fear Downhill Mountain Bike Racing) is a mountain bike video game released in 1999 on PlayStation and 2001 on the Game Boy Color. The Dreamcast version was planned but never released. The game was developed and published by Codemasters.


== Gameplay ==
An extreme sports game, the mountain bike consists of mountain tracks from circuits around the world of varying difficulty. The game was inspired by tracks including San Francisco's Telegraph Hill and New Zealand's Matukituki Rapids.
The game has eight different riders and a number of tracks for the bikes to descend.


== Reception ==
Tom Russo reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that "This downhill mountain-bike racer is quirky fun, but the limitations are enough to keep it at two stars"
