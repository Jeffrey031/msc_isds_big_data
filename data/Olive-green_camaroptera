The olive-green camaroptera was described by the German ornithologist Anton Reichenow in 1895 under its current binomial name Camaroptera chloronota. The type locality is the forest of Missahohe in the West African state of Togo. The specific epithet chloronota is from the Ancient Greek khlōros meaning "green" and -nōtos meaning "-backed".There are five subspecies:

C. c. kamitugaensis Prigogine, 1961 – east DR Congo
