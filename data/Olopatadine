Olopatadine was patented in 1986 by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo and came into medical use in 1997.In the United States, Pataday Twice Daily Relief was first approved by the FDA in 1996, under the name Patanol as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (referring to ocular redness and itching due to allergies). Pataday – now Pataday Once Daily Relief – was first approved by the FDA in 2004, as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. These drugs are mast cell stabilizers, which work by preventing the release of histamine and therefore prevent or control allergic disorders. In February 2020, Pataday Twice Daily Relief and Pataday Once Daily Relief were switched to be over-the-counter drugs and the FDA granted the approvals of the nonprescription products to Alcon.
