== Early life ==
Om'Mas Keith was born on December 20, 1976 in Queens, New York. Keith was exposed to music from an early age, as his parents were both avant-garde jazz musicians, working alongside Sun Ra, and his grandfather had a musical career working with Duke Ellington. His name is derived from Om, the sacred sound of the universe according to Indian religions.

Keith's music career began in 1994, when he took an internship with RCA records in New York City, after having performed poorly at John Bowne High School by skipping academic classes to participate in band. He also attended the Institute of Audio Research, but left before completion to focus on his internship and music production. He garnered the attention of Jam Master Jay, who took him under his wing, along with Ice-T, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Suave House's Tony Draper, and Ultramagnetic MCs, who flew him to Los Angeles and enlisted his work as a producer, where he met his Sa-Ra bandmate Shafiq Husayn.
While building his early career as a producer, Keith also worked in advertising, and as a studio manager and designer while trying to support his daughter, who was born in 1997
