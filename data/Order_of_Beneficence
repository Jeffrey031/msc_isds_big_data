The Order of Beneficence (Greek: Τάγμα της Ευποιΐας), is an order of Greece, that was established in 1948. 
It is conferred by the Greek government as a moral reward for women especially, Greek and foreign, for the good services they have rendered to the Fatherland in the field of charity as well as for their performance in the arts and letters. The fact that the order is awarded to women does not mean that the other Greek decorations are awarded exclusively to men.


== Grades ==
The Order has five classes:

Grand Cross - wears the badge on a sash from the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest;
Grand Commander - wears the badge on a bow, plus the star on the right chest;
Commander - wears the badge on a bow;
Gold Cross - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest;
Silver Cross - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest.


== Insignia ==
The badge of the Order is a five tipped blue-enamelled flower, in silver for the Silver Cross class, in gold for the higher classes. The overall design is clearly derived from the then-recently abolished British Order of the Indian Empire. The obverse central disc bears a portrait of the Holy Virgin with the Divine Child in Her arms with the legend "ΕΥΠΟΙΙΑ" («Beneficence») on a white enamel ring. The reverse side bears the emblem of the Hellenic Republic.
The star of the Order is a silver eight-pointed star with straight rays, with the same central disc as the obverse of the badge, while the reverse side also bears the emblem of the Hellenic Republic. 
The ribbon of the Order is orange with blue edges.
