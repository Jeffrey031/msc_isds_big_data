Otto IV (1248, Ornans – 1302) was the count of the Free County of Burgundy from 1279 until 1302.
Otto was the son of Hugh of Châlons and Adelaide, Countess Palatine of Burgundy. Upon his father's death in 1266/7, he became Count of Châlons. His mother, Adelaide, died on March 8, 1279, and Otto inherited her county. However, he was unable to secure real power in the county until 1295. His son and elder daughter Joan II succeeded in the County of Burgundy.
His wife Mahaut drew up a contract on June 4, 1312 with the famous tomb maker Jean Pepin de Huy to make a tomb. The contract specifies a tomb made of stone and alabaster. Otto was to be shown as an armed knight with a shield, sword and armor. A lion was shown beneath his feet with two angels to support the pillow under his head. The tomb no longer exists, but the designs have been preserved.
