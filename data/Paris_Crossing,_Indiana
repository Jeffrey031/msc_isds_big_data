== History ==
Paris Indiana was named for Paris, France. Graham Creek reminded the French settlers of the Seine River. It was the intersection of two main roads so many people settled there. In time, Paris had 7 taverns, 4 doctors. 2 general stores, a winery, a blacksmith, a funeral parlor and a wagon factory. Paris received a vote for the state capital.
Jefferson County (Madison) made an offer to Jennings County (Vernon) to give them the town of Paris. They explained when a bar fight broke out, by the time the sheriff got there, everyone was gone. Jennings County accepted the offer, even though their sheriff was also 12 miles away.
In 1858, the railroad came thru, a mile west of Paris. So its name was changed to Old Paris. Paris Crossing was named from the location by the railroad outside of Paris, Indiana. The Paris Crossing post office was established in 1876.
