Patience is the 13th studio album by Peter Hammill. It was released in August 1983 on Naive Records, a label founded by Gordian Troeller, the former manager of Hammill's band Van der Graaf Generator. It was remastered in 1991 and released on Fie! Records. It was the second album to feature the collective known as the K Group (the first was Enter K) — Hammill, Guy Evans (Hammill's former colleague in VdGG), John Ellis (of The Vibrators), and Nic Potter (also occasionally of VdGG.)
Patience reached #15 in the UK Indie Chart.The members of the K Group adopted aliases for this and some other recordings. Hammill was "K", Evans was "Brain", Ellis was "Fury" and Potter was "Mozart".
"Patient", "Traintime" and "Comfortable" have all been played regularly by Hammill in live performance in recent years.
"Just good Friends" was re-worked for Hammill's 1984 album The Love Songs.
