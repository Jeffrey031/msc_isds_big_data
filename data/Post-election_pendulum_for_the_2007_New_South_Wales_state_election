The following is a Mackerras Pendulum for the New South Wales state election 2007.
"Safe" seats require a swing of over 10 per cent to change, "fairly safe" seats require a swing of between 6 and 10 points, while "marginal" seats require a swing of less than 6 points.


== Legislative Assembly ==
Changes in the pendulum since the 2007 election resulted through by-elections in the Labor held seats of Ryde in 2008 and Penrith in 2010. Both seats were won by the Liberal opposition in record swings against the Labor Government of 25 points in Penrith and 23 points in Ryde.
