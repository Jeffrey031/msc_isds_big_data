== Reception ==
Matt Poirier from the blog "Direct to Video Connoisseur" praised Wincott and Madsen performances, but concluded: "You've seen this before, and while it has some good performances, it doesn't bring much new to the table and has dead moments that hurt things. Sometimes Wincott and Madsen are enough, sometimes they aren't."
