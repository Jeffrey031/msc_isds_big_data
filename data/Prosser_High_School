== Proposed new campus ==
The school district has been trying to build a new, larger high school to replace the existing campus, which was built in 1936.  The current campus is overcrowded and run-down, with about 900 students attending a facility built for 500 students. District officials have held bond elections three times so far, once in 2005 and again in February and April 2011, in an attempt to get voter approval of a new school. In February of 2017, another election was held and the bond passed with a 73% vote yes.  Construction on the new high school began in May of 2019 and is currently ongoing.
