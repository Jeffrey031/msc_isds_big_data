The Reichsgau Salzburg (English: Gau Salzburg) was an administrative division of Nazi Germany in Salzburg, Austria. It existed between 1938 and 1945.


== History ==
The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. In March 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria, with the latter being sub-divided into Reichsgaue.At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiter were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau.The position of Gauleiter in Salzburg was initially held by Friedrich Rainer and, from 1941, by Gustav Adolf Scheel while Anton Wintersteiger held the office of deputy Gauleiter throughout the Reichsgau's history from 1938 to 1945.
