Samuel Roger Horchow (born July 3, 1928 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a catalog entrepreneur and Broadway producer.
In 1971, Horchow started The Horchow Collection, the first luxury mail-order catalog that was not preceded by a brick-and-mortar presence.  He sold the Horchow Collection to Neiman Marcus in 1988.
In 1992, he produced his first Broadway show, Crazy for You, a George Gershwin musical, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Musical.  The London version of Crazy for You won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical.  Though Crazy for You was inspired by an earlier Gershwin musical, Girl Crazy, which opened in 1930, theater critics and the American Theater Wing ultimately considered it to be a "new musical."  Crazy for You was directed by Mike Ockrent and choreographed by Susan Stroman.
In 2000, Horchow and co-producer Roger Berlind staged a revival of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate, for which he won his second Tony Award, for Best Musical Revival.
