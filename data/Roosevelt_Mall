== History ==
Since opening in 1964, Roosevelt Mall anchors have included S. Klein, Wanamaker's, Hecht's, Strawbridge's, and Macy's.  The original anchor, S. Klein, closed in 1975 due to financial problems of its owner, McCrory Stores.  it was replaced by Wanamaker's in 1976 and was converted to Hecht's in 1995 following May Department Stores' acquisition of the Wanamaker's chain.  About a year later, Hecht's became Strawbridge's.  During the Strawbridge's years, it had a bargain basement in which all furniture and goods were marked down by 80%.  Following Federated Department Stores' acquisition of May Department Stores in 2005, Strawbridge's was rebranded as Macy's.The mall is also home to one of Philadelphia's oldest and most notable cheesesteak restaurant chains, Jim's Steaks, which was founded in West Philadelphia in 1939 and also operates on South Street in Philadelphia.

Located directly across from Roosevelt Mall is Great Northeast Plaza, which was formerly anchored by Sears.  Prior to Sears, it was anchored by Gimbels.
