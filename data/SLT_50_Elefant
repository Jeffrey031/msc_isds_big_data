The SLT 50 is a heavy duty tractor unit and tank transporter used by the German Army and Polish Army.


== History ==
To replace the first generation tank transporter then in use, as well as to be able to haul the armoured vehicles then in service (among them the Leopard 1 Main Battle Tank), the German Army asked Faun GmbH to develop a new all-terrain heavy tractor, and in parallel Krupp was asked to develop the tank transport semi-trailer.
The result was the SLT 50-2 tractor and the 52-ton SaAnh semi-trailer. The combination was first tested in 1971. The first production combination was delivered in April 1976. Some 324 were built up to 1979, in one series, by Faun (tractor) and Kässbohrer (trailer, under Krupp license).To be able to cope with the newest versions of the Leopard 2 MBT, the vehicles were upgraded from 1994 to the standard SLT 50-3. This modernisation program was completed in 2000, and it is expected that the vehicles will be able to operate until 2015.
