During the incident, Rahman went behind a sight screen and assaulted a young boy who had made a noise towards him during an innings break on the second day of the match. Rahman was questioned by the match referee on day three, at which point Rahman got "physically aggressive".On 28 July, the BCB started investigations after Rahman allegedly threatened two fans on Facebook following an ODI loss to West Indies. The incident started when one of the fans made a sarcastic comment regarding Rahman's form on the account of "Shabbir Rahaman Roman", which is believed to be Rahman's personal Facebook account. Rahman then responded by allegedly sending messages containing foul language and threats of physical harm. In September 2018, the BCB recommended a six-month suspension from international cricket.
