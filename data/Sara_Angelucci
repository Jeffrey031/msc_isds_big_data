Her work has been included in group shows internationally in the United States, Europe, and at the Pingyao Biennale in China.Angelucci's works explore archival materials such as home movies, snapshots and vintage portraits and their limitations. Her major works include Aviary (2013), an exhibition of avian-morphed, faux-Victorian portrait photography, video and audio in the collection of Art Gallery of York University. The photographs in Aviary embody many themes of the nineteenth century. Born of the domestic realm, they express a conflation of interests where the family photo album, with its role of commemoration, is brought together with natural science and spiritual emanations. Made by combining photographs of endangered or extinct North American birds with anonymous nineteenth century cartes-de-visite portraitsâ€”they portray creatures about to become ghosts. Of the two extinct birds featured in the series, the plight of the passenger pigeon is particularly telling. Once the most numerous bird in North America, numbering in the billions, it was wiped out by 1914 through a combination of brutal over-hunting and habitat destruction.She served as an Artist-in-residence at the Art Gallery of Ontario from November 2013 to January 2014.Currently, she is an Adjunct Professor in Photography at the School of Image Arts at Ryerson University.
