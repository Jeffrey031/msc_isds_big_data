== History ==
In 1902, Gabby Anderson built a western-style saloon to serve as "an exclusive, all-men's bar and a meeting place for old folks." His reason for the saloon is because he believed "this is where the West begins." However, it is believed that the slogan started because Scott was where eastern train fare rates ended and western train, referred to as the "West Line", fare rates began.

The Union Pacific Railroad, formerly the Southern Pacific Railway, cuts the town in two. The first settler of Scott was Alexander Delhomme, who took land in the northern part of the town. Delhomme owned the first hay-mowing machine, grist mill and cotton gin. By 1880, the train depot was completed and the town became a village. In 1907, the town was incorporated and named after J. B. Scott, who was division superintendent of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The village became a town in 1960, and the town became a city in 1990.On April 12, 2012, Scott was designated by the Louisiana State Legislature as the "Boudin Capital of the World", referring to Cajun sausage. This meant that two other Louisiana towns needed to relinquish their titles. Broussard, also in Lafayette Parish, is now known as the "former Boudin Capital of the World" but has adopted the unofficial title of "Intergalactic Boudin Capital of Positive Infinity", and Jennings, in Jefferson Davis Parish, owns the title of "Boudin Capital of the Universe". The city of Scott's claim to the title is substantial, with more boudin purveyors per-capita than any other place in the state and a couple of the more prominent boudin makers to boot, no other city in Louisiana produces more links than Scott.
