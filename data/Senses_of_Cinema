== Format ==
Every issue of Senses of Cinema follows roughly the same format: about a dozen "featured articles," often related to a unifying theme, a special dossier often devoted to some aspect of Australian cinema, reports from various major international, regional and underground film festivals, book reviews, and articles devoted to recent screenings and retrospectives at the Melbourne Cinematheque.
Senses of Cinema regularly publishes interviews in its featured articles section.


=== Great directors ===
Senses of Cinema maintains a database of career overview essays on "great directors." The essays range in scope and length, but they all maintain an auteurist perspective on the filmmakers' work.
