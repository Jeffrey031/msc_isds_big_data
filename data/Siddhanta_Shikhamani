Siddhantha Shikhamani is a religious scripture of the Panchacharyas tradition of Veerashaivas, also known as   Lingayatism. It is regarded as Dharmagrantha ("sacred scripture") of Veerashaivism.


== History ==
Traditionally, Siddhantha Shikhamani is attributed to Sri Shivayogi Shivacharya, and is said to contain the preachings of Jagaduru Renukacharya, the first Panchacharya. It was written in Sanskrit, and gives an elaboration of "the primitive traits of Veerashaivism [found] in the Vedas and the Upanishads" and "the concrete features given to it in the latter parts (Uttarabhaga) of the Saivagamas."

== Contents ==
According to M. Sivakumara Swamy, "The doctrine of one hundred and one Sthalas is the central teaching of the text. This doctrine is developed in the form of a dialogue between Sri Renuka, one of the five holy Acharyas (Panchacharyas) of yore who founded Virasaivism, and Agastya, the pitcher-born sage of Pancavati."The introduction (ch. 1-5) starts with a prayer to Shiva, the supreme lord. The introduction further states that Veerashaiva philosophy is equivalent to the Vedas and all knowledge of Upanishads and Agamas (Ch.3, Sl.71, SN.139), and narrates how Panchacharya Shree Jagadguru Renukacharya sprang from Someshwara Linga at Kolipaki (ch. 3 and 4), who transmitted the Veerashaiva philosophy to Sage Agasthya (ch.5), to be written down by Shivayogi Shivacharya (ch.1).
