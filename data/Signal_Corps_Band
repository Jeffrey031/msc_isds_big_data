It was activated in 1943 as the band of the 4th Engineer Amphibian Brigade and was posted to Fort Gordon, Georgia, for most of its existence. The band was inactivated in 2016.
The Signal Corps Band did not share a common lineage with an identically named unit active from 1930 to 1944.


== History ==


=== Predecessor unit ===
The band of the 13th Cavalry Regiment was organized in 1901. In 1916 it saw action in New Mexico at the Battle of Columbus where it became separated from the rest of the regiment and had to engage Villistas armed only with pistols, during which three bandsmen were killed in action.  Inactivated in 1930, its equipment and personnel were reorganized as the newly activated Signal Corps Band.In 1941 Edward Matlack, great-great grandson of Timothy Matlack, the scribe of the United States Declaration of Independence and Secretary of the Supreme Council of Pennsylvania, was among the Signal Corps Band's personnel. The band was inactivated in 1944 and its equipment and personnel used to form the 389th Army Band, which was later given the special designation Army Materiel Command Band before being inactivated in 2018.

The Signal Corps Band, officially known as the 434th Army Band, was activated in February 1943 within the Army of the United States as the band of the 4th Engineer Amphibian Brigade at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. In 1944 it was redesignated the 434th Army Service Forces Band, before being inactivated two years later. In 1955 it was reactivated within the regular United States Army at Fort Gordon, Georgia and redesignated as the 434th Army Band. In 1985 it received the special designation "United States Army Signal Corps Band" commonly rendered as "Signal Corps Band".In 2013 the Army announced the band would be inactivated within three years. It was inactivated in October 2016, and its colors were cased and transferred to the Center for Military History for storage.
