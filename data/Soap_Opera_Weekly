Soap Opera Weekly was a weekly magazine covering American daytime soap operas. It featured onscreen and offscreen news about the series, interviews with and articles about performers, storyline summaries and analysis, and related promotional information. Launched in November 1989 by News Corporation with Mimi Torchin as editor-in-chief, Weekly began as a sister magazine to Soap Opera Digest. News Corporation sold the magazine to K-III in 1991. K-III was renamed Primedia, and sold its magazines to Source Interlink in 2007.
American Media, Inc. took over Source Interlink's soap magazines in 2011; Soap Opera Weekly was closed in 2012.
