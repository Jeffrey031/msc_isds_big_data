The St. George's Award is the highest youth award achievable in the Senior Scouts section of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.
The St. George's Award, like the Queen's Scout Award, is conferred on the recipient; you are not awarded the St. George's Award, you become a St. George's Scout.  The Award is named for St. George, the patron saint of Scouting, and marks the completion of many requirements met during their time in the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.  The St. George's Award needs to be completed before the Senior Scout's 18th birthday.
