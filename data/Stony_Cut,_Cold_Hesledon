Stony Cut, Cold Hesledon is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in the Easington district of north-east County Durham, England. It consists of a shallow cutting alongside Seaham Golf Course close to the village of Cold Hesledon.
The cutting exposes a section of Late Permian Ford Formation (Zechstein) dolomite in which the transition from the flat to the crest of the shelf-edge of an ancient reef is clearly visible. The site has been designated as of national importance in the Geological Conservation Review.
