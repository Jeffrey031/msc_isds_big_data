SummerTyne Americana Festival is an annual music festival held in July since 2006.  It takes place in and around Sage Gateshead in North East England, next to the River Tyne, near the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and NewcastleGateshead's Quayside. As well as ticketed concerts within the building, the festival encompasses free outdoor music as well as family-focused and participatory elements.
In past years SummerTyne Americana Festival has hosted an eclectic roster of acts, with many styles represented.  2010’s festival (22–25 July) was billed as "SummerTyne Americana": the "Americana" element has previously been just one element of the Festival, but in 2010 was the full theme of the Festival, encompassing principally country music, but with many types of American music represented.
