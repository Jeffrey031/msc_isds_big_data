Superintelligence is an upcoming American action comedy film directed by Ben Falcone and written by Steve Mallory. Melissa McCarthy will star in what will be her fourth collaboration with her husband, Falcone.


== Premise ==
Nothing extraordinary ever happens to Carol Peters, so when she starts getting snarky backtalk from her TV, phone and microwave, she thinks she’s being punked or losing her mind. In fact, the world’s first superintelligence has selected her for observation, taking over her life…with a bigger, more ominous plan to take over everything. Now Carol is humanity’s last chance before this artificial intelligence-with-an-attitude decides to pull the plug.
