In late 2013, Cassell was paid $30,000, along with other influential YouTubers, to promote Microsoft's newly launched Xbox One console as part of a promotional campaign managed by Microsoft's advertising agency and operated by Machinima Inc. The endorsement ran afoul of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations because "influencers", including Cassell, had failed to disclose that they "were paid by Microsoft to say nice things about Xbox One and its games".In August 2015, Gamasutra reported that Cassell had again violated FTC guidelines on disclosures for YouTubers due to publishing multiple let's play videos of 3BlackDot's game Dead Realm without disclosing their financial ties to the product.Cassell was heavily criticized and became a defendant in a class-action lawsuit in July 2016 when he promoted the gambling website CSGOLotto.com without disclosing a conflict of interest as vice-president of the company, again violating TFC regulations. After his role at the company was revealed by others, Cassell promised in a statement posted on Twitter that he would be more transparent in the future.
