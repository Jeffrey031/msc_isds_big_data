Traveller Deluxe Edition is a 1981 role-playing game supplement published by Game Designers' Workshop, a boxed set edition for Traveller.


== Contents ==
Traveller Deluxe Edition is a boxed set intended to make the Traveller system even easier to play and understand, and was designed more with the new player or beginner in mind than those looking for greater intricacies and complexities.


== Reception ==
William A. Barton reviewed Traveller Deluxe Edition in The Space Gamer No. 44. Barton commented that "Deluxe Traveller is an excellent addition to the Traveller line â€“ especially for the new player and referee.  And even the old-timer Travellers who want the second edition rules wouldn't go far wrong by going the extra price for the deluxe edition."
