== Notes ==
"Somebody That I Used to Know" became the first collaboration between separate artists to top the Hottest 100.
For the second consecutive year and the third time ever, the #1 song featured a female vocalist. This was also the second consecutive year the #1 song was a duet between a male and a female artist.
Kimbra became the first New Zealand artist to feature in the #1 song of a Hottest 100.
The original version by Arcade Fire of the #100 song, "The Suburbs", was the #58 song in the previous year's Hottest 100. Similarly, Owl Eyes' cover of "Pumped Up Kicks" was #28, four places higher than what the original version by Foster the People could manage the previous year.
For the third year in a row an artist from Triple J Unearthed got in the Top 10. This year it was Boy & Bear, San Cisco and The Jezabels. Also, the 2010 and 2011 Unearthed High winners (Stonefield and Snakadaktal) both made their first appearances in the Hottest 100. This is the first time this has been done.
Producer Francois Tetaz helped write, produce and mix eight songs that charted in the countdown. The songs he helped write/produce/mix were all the songs by Architecture in Helsinki, Kimbra and Gotye.
This is the first countdown since 1995 not to feature any previous Hottest 100 winners.
