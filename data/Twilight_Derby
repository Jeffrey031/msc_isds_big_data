The Twilight Derby is a race for thoroughbred horses run at Santa Anita Park during the fall meet each year.  The Grade IIT event is open to three-year-old horses willing to race ​1 1⁄8 miles on the turf and offers a purse of $200,000.
The Twilight Derby was inaugurated in 1969 as the Volante Handicap, and was named for Lucky Baldwin's 1885 American Derby winner, Volante, who was rode to the finish line by jockey Isaac Burns Murphy. In 1997 the Volante Handicap was renamed the Oak Tree Derby after the Oak Tree Racing Association. It was run on the undercard of the Saturday Breeders' Cup card in 2008, 2009 and 2016. In 2010, the race was run at Hollywood Park.
