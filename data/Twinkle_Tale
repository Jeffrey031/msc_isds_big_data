In the beginning, darkness and silence prevailed before the creation of the world until three lights; red, green and blue, were born within.

As a result, Raza bestows upon Saria three magicial items so she can go and defeat Gadou and his forces.Saria travels to the plains of Talon and reaches the castle of her mentor, the great red wizard Olof, to rescue him. Once freed from his captivity, Olof explains to Saria that one of the reason for the rebellion to occur was due to Gadou violating the ban in not using the powers of his gemstone, an onyx, for personal use to control the darkness and communicate with hell, as well as trying to increase his strength through black magic, which infuriated the king of the land and imprisoned him on his castle and barely managed to confiscate the onyx, with him also informing to her that the main source of his powers, a ruby, was taken away and he has go to the diamond palace to protect the king, but not before telling her to rescue his comrades. Saria goes through the land's vine ravines before arriving and rescuing the great green wizard Dohla on his castle, who regretfully tells her that his emerald was also taken way.
