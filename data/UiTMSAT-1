UiTMSAT-1 is a Malaysian nanosatellite, built primarily by Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) as part of the multi-nation Birds-2 project. The 1U CubeSat was launched into space in June 2018 and deployed from the ISS in August.


== Background ==
Malaysia has had several satellites in orbit, beginning with the MEASAT constellation, first operational in 1996. Their first microsatellite, TiungSat-1, was launched in 2000.


== Development ==
Planning for the mission began in December 2016 at the Kyushu Institute of Technology. UiTM postgraduate students Syazana Basyirah Mohammad Zaki and Muhammad Hasif Azami developed the satellite over a 19-month period and collaborated with eight other students from the Philippines, Bhutan, and Japan. This collaboration also inspired the creation of a new Communication Satellite Centre at UiTM.


== Objectives ==
Demonstrate an Automatic Packet Reporting System Digipeater to communicate with amateur radio stations
Detect a specific type of solar radiation called "single event latch-up"
Measure magnetic fields through the use of an Anisotropic Magneto Resistance Magnetometer
Act as an Earth Imaging Camera


== Launch and mission ==

UiTMSAT-1 was launched to space on 29 June 2018 via the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket at Cape Canaveral in Florida, United States as part of the SpaceX CRS-15 Commercial Resupply Service mission. Maya-1 and BHUTAN-1, which were also developed under the Birds-2 project, were among the payload of the rocket. All three nanosatellites were deployed from the ISS and achieved orbit on 10 August 2018.
